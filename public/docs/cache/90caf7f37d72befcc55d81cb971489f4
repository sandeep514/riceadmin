He won the first-ever Calder Trophy in 1937. You may have created an account with another Rogers Media account that can be used to sign in here. Harry Lumley: Despite the fact that he wore no arm pads in net, (going black and blue over the course of a season), Lumley posted 13 shutouts in 1953 – still a Leafs record. 17. 8. 19. The use of the Leafs sweater was an attempt to connect him and his business with the city in an organic way. Your favorite teams, topics, and players all on your favorite mobile devices. Enter your email address to get a new one. Frank Mahovlich: The highest-scoring left winger the franchise has ever seen, he nearly became the second 50-goal scorer in NHL history with 48 markers in 1960-61. Powered by Minute Media © 2020 All Rights Reserved. Though he is a talented actor, it turns out that Crowe’s taste in hockey teams is much to be desired. It turns out that he is actually a Rangers fan. Charlie Conacher: He was big, he was fast, he put the puck in the net for the Blue and White. One could debate whether a couple of months of supporting a franchise qualifies as a fan. George Armstrong: One of the greatest captains in franchise history, “the Chief” potted an empty-net goal to help the team seal its last Stanley Cup win in 1967. The “dart” was there to help cope with the stress of that game.

If so, then Harington is a welcome member of the fanbase. The Leafs may have lost, but they had the stars on their side. Dave Keon: Winner of four Stanley Cups, Keon could be the best player on the ice and the key to winning even when he didn’t score. Others have become celebrities because of their love for the Maple Leafs. The right winger scored 299 goals as a Leafs at a rate of 0.56 per game, the best in team history. Relax… we shot Cinderella Man in the old Maple Leaf Gardens.It looks like a leafs hat but it’s actually a CM crew hat.I’m a @penguins fan. Johnny Bower: Bower didn’t suit up between the pipes for the Leafs until he was 33, but became a star as soon as he did. You can change your selection at any time. The Late Night host and funny man, David Letterman, was revealed to sport a Leafs sweater as a young man by the official Twitter account of the team. 16. That’s really all you need to know.

Toronto Maple Leafs - Justin Bieber (Photo by George Pimentel/WireImage), Queen Elizabeth II (Photo by Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images). Bill Barilko is remembered well by Maple Leafs fans and the organization. Because of the demand for season tickets, their sale is limited to the 10,000 people on the waiting list. 28. The pictures were from 2013 when Harington was in Toronto shooting the movie Pompeii. The Toronto Raptors gained extra attention in their title-winning playoffs run thanks to the presence of the team’s global ambassador, Drake. In the stands, they have attracted a long list of famous fans. It does not make their love of the team any less meaningful. And to think he centred the third line behind Apps and Kennedy. Busher Jackson: Effortless scorer, smooth skater, singular talent, alcoholic, convict – Jackson’s playing days as part of the “Kid Line” were as bright as his post-playing days were dark. The model-actress is such a big fan, the team asked her to drop the puck launching their 2007-2008 season. Let’s meet them now. Lanny McDonald: Far more than just the owner of the hockey world’s most recognizable ‘stache, McDonald had talent and a work ethic to match, and was a standout two-way player in seven seasons with the leafs. Fan base. We all know that. An error has occurred while trying to update your details. This led to speculation that Letterman was a fan of the team. Red Kelly: A Leafs fan long before he ever put on the sweater, the Toronto-born pivot made eight semifinals in his eight years with the team. 13. Playing the role of David Puddy, the fan digitally inserted himself into a 1995 Seinfeld episode, known as “The Face Painter.” He answered the question nobody was asking: what if Puddy was a Leafs fan? Eventually, Crowe responded. He was even captured wearing matching hats with his son. Just because the Queen of England adorned a Maple Leafs brooch, it doesn’t make her a fan of the Buds. Until 2016, only two of the team’s members had their jersey numbers retired. There are however many celebrities who love the team unconditionally. He eventually played the second-most minutes of anyone in team history. Teeder Kennedy: Never the most skilled player, Kennedy worked harder than anyone on the ice and raised the play of his teammates through sheer determination.

He posted his reaction to every Leafs game in his own unique ways. Gordie Drillon: Drillon may have been allergic to back-checking, but he made two All-Star teams and once said he could score 20 goals “with a broom”. Rick Vaive: Vaive’s teams didn’t win, but that was through no fault of his own. Please contact us. Toronto Maple Leafs Celebrity Fans Cheered On The Team At Last Night's Game (PHOTOS) People from outside of Canada love to poke fun at the love that we have for winter sports, but if we're being realistic, they're really not exaggerating - Canadians love hockey.

(approx 1 - 2 per week). 18. There are other pictures of him online wearing the same jersey. The difference between the sports is that fans can sit on the floor at NBA games. Stanley could also provide a scoring punch when needed, and enjoyed his best years in blue and white. By checking this box, I agree to the terms of service and privacy policy of Rogers Media. Steve “Dangle” Glynn became popular as a YouTuber. His picture instantly got the meme treatment and it led to him getting to host his own show on local terrestrial radio.

His look garnered attention because he had his face painted with an unlit cigarette dangling from his mouth. Dart Guy, the nickname given to Jason Maslakow, was attending a game in April of 2017 when his image was captured and broadcast on television. Glynn has parleyed his Leaf fandom into being a blogger and publishing a book.
