KG: Well, it wasn't an issue on this movie because Mel was basically paying for the movie. But then it became clear that, no, it really is Nick Nolte. The movie has a more – I think of it as a more complex ending. My father tended to be very tortured in his work. KG: No. That's the kind of question somebody asks when they're really trying to get inside the character. I'm happy. So that was probably the single biggest lesson out of that one. Certainly working with Nolte was amazing; he was the most amazing actor I’ve worked with [in terms of] how he combined the technical and the emotional. There are a lot of people out there pulling for him. KG: Oh absolutely. But I knew that I didn’t and that kind of drove me crazy in both a good and a bad way. Like the scene on the subway (a strikingly intimate conversation between the lovers that is one of the best moments in the movie).         Cookie Policy And that was, I thought, a really great lesson in sort of the social organisation of filmmaking, which is as important as anything else. You know, the set’s gonna fall down, this actor is suddenly sick, this person is having a nervous breakdown and you have to deal with all that. KG: Well, what happened was, Fine Line had always loved the script. An excitable fast-talking, supremely out-going, completely normal guy with an absolute passion for movies and without an iota of show business pretense, when I met him, I was the last journalist he had to talk to on the last day of his publicity tour to promote his overlooked, emotionally charged psychological drama "Waking the Dead." Voted America's worst human by the Earth, Gordon Keith is actually asked to leave this interview with Emma Stone.Veteran newcomer Gordon Keith has quickly established himself in Hollywood as the worst interviewer in America. KG: Well, every case is different. When Static was done, this guy Jonathan Krane, who was like a young entrepreneurial manager – he still manages John Travolta – was setting up an independent film production company called MCEG. He's used to really completely improvising. The writing and acting on the shows I’m lucky enough to get to do is as good or better than anything in the feature world. Your films are carefully crafted, often maintaining a dark sensibility while conveying a sense of humour as well. Click here to make a donation. Everybody loved it, but in the end nobody wanted to put that kind of money up for what is essentially an experimental film. But he's a really, really good human being. It was a remarkable experience in terms of the way my father would break down a piece and examine what scenes were really about. And I feel very lucky that I’ve never been at the point where I haven’t been able to. But, yeah, I know what you mean. He was scared -- this was an impossible role, you know? So the combination of that negative and the fact that my passion was kind of more for the whole than for the piece of it that acting represented. I felt like that isn’t something I would have written.” And Bob said, “Except that that’s in the book!” [Laughter] Kurt was like, “Oh, OK. Well, that’s what happens when you don’t read your own book for 30 years.” But that’s how good the script was. I tried taking what was best about his work – a wonderful intellectual rigour – but combine it with a fun and openhearted approach that I’d seen other directors have. Kurt literally didn’t remember – literally – what scenes were what. KG: That mix is always challenging, but it’s also a mix that speaks to me as a film viewer. I mean, it was scary, of course, but there was a certain sense of calm that I never had as an actor. Where do you see the future of independent films heading? When I was growing up, most of his income came from doing television commercials – that was sort of what paid the rent and he did a lot of those out of New York. So it didn’t feel like we were just running in circles. It takes a month to do an hour-long TV show from the point that you received the script to the final edit. The book seems really good to me.” It has good dialogue and I liked the structure of it. KG: Recently I had my first day of prep for Masters of Sex; I’m just getting my feet wet. Although frequently depicted as three-headed, two is acceptable. And even festivals are being swamped with good material and can’t show everything. My agents sent me American Beauty. And he's like, "Nobody realized how good she is. He just said, "I found this bunch of poems that to me mean something about this movie." I’ll protect you from them.” But because he wasn’t strong enough in the end to do it, it meant I had no relationship with them and they just saw me as this petulant director. PT: What was it like working with John Carpenter on Christine? And so we started from that idea and we built outwards. Then we went to Robert De Niro and it took about five months to get a response and the response we got back from his company was that, “Well, he might be interested in directing it but not acting in it”, which didn’t really do us a lot of good. Katie was actually Robert and Mel's suggestion. All of those things add to the budget. He wants to be alive. I nominated you for a Liebster Award!

So, for somebody like me who had an interest in filmmaking, it was fabulous because I was not only making a movie. Very soon after this I’m going to South Africa to do an episode of Homeland. Then we just sat around drinking beers until 8 in the morning, watching tapes of "South Park." Gen. Jack D. Ripper in "Dr. Strangelove") to go look at, and he'd come back the next day for rehearsal and he'd suddenly kind of look like him. Everybody around him had a lot of reason to not let this happen. It's my script, it's not Shakespeare. In an age when many American independent films are marked by nihilistic attitudes, Gordon’s films are made by a man who cares intensely about the world; and when just as many are marked by careless, thoughtless moviemaking, Gordon’s display stylistic precision, coherence, and, above all, beauty.
