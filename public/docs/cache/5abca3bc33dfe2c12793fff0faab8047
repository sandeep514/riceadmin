Michael and Kristine have been arrested and charged on two counts of felony child neglect. Michael Barnett filed a similar motion that will likely have the same result due to the ruling made on Kristine's motion. The former Westfield couple still face six charges of neglect of a dependent for leaving their adoptive Ukrainian orphaned daughter with severe dwarfism in Lafayette and moving to Canada. Michael and myself were physically exhausted so we asked her to wait just a few minutes,’ she said. Michael Barnett turns himself in: Man accused of changing adopted daughter's age, abandoning her. Reach Ron Wilkins at 765-420-5231 or at rwilkins@jconline.com. Oz." Sorry, this video isn't available any more. Furthermore the affidavit adds: 'Michael Barnett admitted Kristine Barnett told Natalia to tell others Natalia looks young but was actually 22.’. I had just been told she was a six year old and it was very apparent she wasn't,’ she added. For more stories like this, check our news page. When they adopted the girl from Ukraine in 2010 doctors estimated that she was eight years old. He is due to appear at hearing in Tippecanoe Superior Court in Lafayette on September 24. The couple have previously appeared on the US show 60 Minutes discussing their then 13-year-old son Jacob, who is said to be a child genius. His mother also wrote "The Spark," a book about raising a child genius. Natalia appeared on the Dr. Phil show in November and denied that she was an adult. He thought he was doing the right thing 10 years ago when he took someone into his home," Kinnard said. Michael shares his story on True Crime, a Dr. Oz series. It was also in 2012 that police first began asking questions, although correspondence reviewed by DailyMailTV suggests they were trying to establish whether an immigration fraud took place before the Barnetts had any involvement with Natalia. A couple have denied abandoning their adopted daughter after legally changing her age then moving country. The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline. While living with the Barnetts, Natalia's adoption was completed in November that year. ‘I always wanted to have a larger family and I had very severe complications in my pregnancies and was unable to have more children,’ Barnett explained. Here's what I'm going to do with their bodies,” Michael Barnett said. ‘Police knocked on Michael’s door and he spoke to them, for three hours, without an attorney present. Kristine Barnett confronted the girl after catching her pour household cleaner into her coffee, Michael Barnett said. Prosecutors tracked down Natalia's birth mother — Anna Gava — in Ukraine, Tippecanoe County Deputy Prosecutor Jackie Starbuck said last week during a hearing for Michael Barnett's motion to dismiss. “It was a big move for our family and one that we knew was coming for Jacob,” Kristine Barnett told the IndyStar that year. The case was dismissed in January 2018 without a guardian being appointed. Jacob who has autism is said to have a higher IQ than Albert Einstein. A probable cause affidavit outlined various congenital health problems Natalia suffers from that make it appear she is much younger than she is. This brings the Barnetts' cases to a standstill until the higher court publishes a ruling and likely will take months. According to the affidavit, Michael Barnett confirmed his daughter's account in an interview with authorities in September 2019, saying the couple adopted her in 2010, that a hospital determined that she was a child in 2012 and that the family left her at an apartment in Lafayette in 2013. 'I co-signed the lease and paid for the rent up front for a year. The Tippecanoe County Sheriff's Department meanwhile presents a very different version of events. The Barnetts, however, said they found the girl actually was a woman and posed as a child when they adopted her, so they changed her age to 22 before the Barnetts moved to Canada in summer 2013 without her. You could see she was going to need a lot of support and care. Kristine and Michael Barnett, the adoptive parents of Natalia — who has a rare form of dwarfism that makes it difficult to gauge her age — have claimed the girl is a mentally disturbed adult who terrorized their family. It is not clear how long the girl stayed in the apartment before authorities were alerted. “It was a plain and simple, matter-of-fact answer. By then, however, Barnett says Natalia had vanished and stopped returning her calls. Barnett said she was communicating daily with Natalia and even came up with a plan for Natalia to enroll in college to get her high school diploma and study cosmetology. At the age of 12, he was already studying physics and developing his own theories of relativity at IUPUI. Barnett  presented DailyMailTV with a trove of paperwork that appears to confirm her version of events – and that health care professionals shared her grave concerns. “While at the stress center, she was documenting, she was telling doctors, she was telling therapists, she was writing down on her notepad. The case drew so much attention that Meyer issued a gag order in late October, barring the people involved in the case from discussing the case with the media. ‘Natalia was living on her own and a couple wanted to become her guardians. She had social security income for the rest of her things. By 2013 Barnett had published a memoir about Jacob, now aged 21, entitled 'The Spark: A Mother’s Story of Nurturing, Genius, and Autism'. 'There was no running to Canada': Dad charged with abandoning daughter on 'Dr. In 2012, the Barnetts, who have other children and are now divorced, had Natalia's age changed in Marion County Probate Court from her real age of eight to 22 and told the girl to say she was 22 if anyone asked. The pair will still face charges of abandonment & neglect of a dependent, due to Natalia's disability. She had adult teeth. Thinking she was still a child, the couple tried to overturn the 2012 result,' explained Michael's attorney Kinnard. Prosecutors want jurors to decide Natalia's age — regardless of what the Marion court order states — and prosecutors have evidence to prove that Natalia just celebrated her 17th birthday this week. However his Indianapolis-based attorney, Terrance Kinnard, denied that his client made any such admission of guilt. Barnett grew more alarmed when she saw the little girl naked for the first time. There was nothing in the paperwork stating that.’. ‘Out of compassion for their situation I didn’t want to press them for information on what had gone wrong,’ the mom went on. It was like something another mom would say as she dropped her kids off. It’s just horrifying.’. 'The most-disturbing thing about this is Michael has told me the police investigator who is heading the latest allegations against them was actually present.'. Britain's most hated man? Today, she is legally 30. The affidavit states: ‘She was left alone in the apartment in Lafayette while the rest of the Barnett family moved to Canada.’. Oz.". Michael Barnett reiterated this during his appearance on the "Dr. Oz" show, adding that the individual threatened to killed Kristine and the family's three biological children.
