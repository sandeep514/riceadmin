It wasn’t because I was getting donations from some special interest or corporation. That doesn’t make any sense. And those folks right now are just being fed what’s coming through that filter. And, you know. Better means the air a little less polluted. You push some more. And if that stuff is still being pumped out and Trump goes away, someone else will meet that market demand. Learn more about your ad choices. And that heart is who he is. Now, that’s part of the reason why he was always late, because, you know, I was pretty good about working the rope ladder. You push. Even a well-meaning president can’t solve everything, but they can make some things better. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices. And so you get that combination. Sports, music, news and podcasts. As you will recall, we wanted a public option in the Affordable Care Act. That makes a difference. And essentially what happened is because the guy just decided he wanted attention, like whether it was to promote Celebrity Apprentice or whatever, he sort of he looked and saw what was being said and he said, oh, if that’s, if that’s what folks want, I can do that with even less inhibition. And I’ve never seen him. So that brings me then to the second issue. No excuse not to do it. New episodes come out on Mondays and Thursdays. If anything, it should have been extended because of COVID. Four former aides to President Obama—Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer and Tommy Vietor—are joined by journalists, politicians, activists, and more for a no-b******t conversation about politics. Quick plug, if you go to VoteSaveAmerica.com, you can find your sample ballot and you can see all those down ballot races that are critical if you’re in California, you can see ballot initiatives. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices, Trump cheers on violent supporters in Kenosha and Portland, Joe Biden gives a speech in Pennsylvania condemning violence and Trump, Covid outbreaks on college campuses get worse, and the White House weighs a strategy of herd immunity and a quick vaccine. You were on both sides of this. One, and I think this is most important, is when people ask me what surprised me most about the presidency, you know, what I always tell them is: I understood but didn’t fully appreciate the degree to which we kind of underwrite the international order. I got the majority of the vote in southern Illinois, which is much closer culturally to Kentucky or southern Indiana, Ohio, than it is Chicago. I have some pretty strong views about it. Learn more about your ad choices. That’s not a schtick, you know, that’s who he is. Jon Favreau Welcome back to the pod. Don’t let the best be the enemy of the good in this situation. Shameless plug. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices, The protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin after the police shooting of Jacob Blake provide the backdrop to a Republican National Convention where the party tries its hardest to stoke division and deny reality. That’s what you always taught me. Do you have an anecdote about Joe Biden that most people don’t know, tell us a story about what kind of a person or leader he is? And clearly it didn’t. But at the same time, you’ll have a lot of people around him were able to translate his good instincts into actual policy that works. You’ve got district attorneys and state’s attorneys who are going to be responsible for whether or not police misconduct is charged and departments are held accountable. One, and I think this is most important, is when people ask me what surprised me most about the presidency, you know, what I always tell them is: I understood but didn’t fully appreciate the degree to which we kind of underwrite the international order. Now I have fewer Democratic votes. Are they people who are able to see the world through somebody else’s eyes and stand in their shoes? Now, he did the same thing with Hillary and the ‘lock her up’ theme. What did you learn about how he thinks about diplomacy and counterterrorism and the use of military force that others would not have seen? But for me to bring up in a meeting, you know ‘you locking up journalists or you mistreating this minority ethnic group is something that the United States objects to’. ‘Well, we think we’re going to try to approach this through herd immunity.’ But at least there’s some coherence to their argument. Commercial-Free CNBC, CNN, FOX News Radio & MSNBC, Commercial-Free Music For Every Mood & Activity. How do you govern in a way that’s both bipartisan and productive, when the only way to break the gridlock with this version of the Republican Party is through huge Democratic majorities, getting rid of the filibuster, other big structural reforms, all of which will be seen by Republicans and much of the media as extremely partisan? One of the very first things we have to do is to get every person who is as fired up as they were about this election to understand the midterms are going to matter just as much. But when you got those folks one on one and they had a chance to meet you and talk to you and you were at a veterans, a V.A. And that’s something I know Joe cares about. But, because of the filibuster and Mitch McConnell systematically wanting to throw sand into the gears, no matter how much outreach we made, as long as the Republicans could maintain unity– and McConnell was very explicit about this, he said ‘Well here’s one thing I’ve learned as long as we can keep Republicans off Obama’s bills, even when it’s their proposals that used to be Republican proposals, then we can rob them of the veneer of bipartisanship. Learn more about your ad choices. The Trump administration is purposely has decided to cut off the census earlier than it should have been. And whatever you think about whether the federal government can help on big major issues like systemic racism. Jon Favreau So, you know, I’m fairly confident that Pod Save America listeners know who they’re voting for at this point. Get out there and keep working after the president is elected. But for those 20 million or those people with preexisting conditions that trying to get insurance, that was that was a lifeline. You guys look good. The filibuster would be one. That makes a difference. Trump is a symptom of it and an accelerant to it. Barack Obama You’ve got mayors races in which the mayor is going to decide who the police chief is and what the contract is with the police and so on, on every issue that young people in particular care. You had this whole myth about me being aloof. I didn’t read the tweet. Jon Favreau On today’s show, the 44th President of the United States, our former boss, responsible for hiring the two of us, Barack Obama. The other thing I think that’s important, you mentioned Joe having voted for the war in Iraq, he learned a lesson from that. Enjoy the videos and music you love, upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube. Then Andre Banks of Win Black / Pa'lante talks to Dan about how we can handle the flood of disinformation being directed at black and brown voters. What is your pitch to these voters? And the reason is because they see me only through the filter of Fox News, Rush Limbaugh. Jon Favreau Easy to do. Barack Obama Still, still questioning that decision. And I think understanding that that is not a failure. These voters generally have a negative view of Trump, but they pay less attention to the news and are less likely to believe that voting will actually make a difference. I think we should give Republicans a chance to work with us around reasonable issues. They also want leaders who will end the gridlock in Washington and actually get something done on the big issues. I don’t want to put the cart before the horse, but you guys know how frustrated I would be when Progressives feeling frustrated would then sit out the midterms. And you can spend. People may fault him for other stuff. Of course not. As I was writing the book, I was just looking through some of the old stuff about Trump. I mean, he was very systematic and strategic about it — What I have concluded, is that the answer is to change some of these structural impediments to just getting stuff done. And I did well in a bunch of white evangelical counties, rural counties that I think is fair to say, there is no way right now that I could get those votes. Barack Obama Well, a couple of things. I don’t think we should be maximalist and ask for 100 percent of what we want all the time. But you don’t hear stories about Joe being just mean to somebody. And there’s nothing wrong with holding folks to account. Hear the audio that matters most to you. It was because I didn’t I didn’t have votes. There are constraints in our system. I needed 60 votes to get it through the Senate. And so I think that we should welcome the argument that making it easier for people to vote and eliminating the last vestiges of Jim Crow and poll taxes and all that stuff is not a partisan issue. Right? Let’s, let’s agree, let’s stipulate that, yeah, the government’s items solve every problem overnight. And you know, when you run for president, pretty much every all your flaws are exposed. One of the very first things we have to do is to get every person who is as fired up as they were about this election to understand the midterms are going to matter just as much. Barack Obama That’s it man. And know, one of the things that I’ve been emphasizing is the degree to which it’s not just the presidential candidates that are on the ticket. President Barack Obama. They call us and say, ‘What are we going to do to help?’ If there is a ethnic cleansing, if there is a conflict, if there is a natural disaster. Because that’s that’s the constraint ultimately that we all confront throughout this process was, when I look back on my presidency, the real envelope, the limit to what I could get done, had to do with how many votes that I have in the House, how many votes do I have in the Senate? And that’s worth fighting for. Well, let’s take some examples just from this year. Learn more about your ad choices. A lot of decisions are made based on those numbers. not have passed Social Security? If I went back to those same places. And you know, when you run for president, pretty much every all your flaws are exposed. Then communications guru Anat Shenker-Osorio talks to Dan about the most effective ways to talk... Trump finishes his weekend of superspreader rallies with a trip to California amid a climate disaster he thinks is a hoax, Mike Bloomberg says he’ll spend at least $100 million in Florida to help Joe Biden, and Bernie Sanders urges Biden to talk more about his economic agenda with young and Latino voters.
