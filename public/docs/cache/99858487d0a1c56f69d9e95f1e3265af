Troy’s fortunes began to decline during the Byzantine era, most probably due to the silting of the city’s harbour cutting off the essential maritime trade that the city was dependant on, with its eventual abandonment during the 14th century AD. In theory, Troy would have been able to use its site astride these two lines of communication to exact tolls from trading vessels and other travelers using them; the actual extent to which this took place, however, remains unclear. For example, there is a return to handmade pottery after centuries of wares made on the wheel. License. Once again, finds of foreign materials suggest trade with Asia. Ancient Troy looks fascinating. Over the years, sabre-toothed cats have also been the subject of many research projects. As Paris refused to return Helen, the War is thought to have lasted about ten years or more and eventually the Greeks won by using the deception of offering the Trojans a statue of a Horse as a gift that they would take inside the Walls of Troy, once inside the statue was filled with the Greek warriors that were able to open the Gates of Troy allowing and the Greeks to overcome, burn and pillage the city. Between 1870 and 1890 Schliemann excavated the area in a brutal fashion. While the city was attacked in 1190 B.C., there are, again, problems with the idea that it was carried out by a Greek force. Ancient History Encyclopedia, 11 May 2018. The war was in fact a ten-year siege of the city by a coalition of Greek forces led by King Agamemnon of Mycenae. "There is no one single Troy; there are at least 10, lying in layers on top of each other," writes University of Amsterdam researcher Gert Jan van Wijngaarden in a chapter of the book "Troy: City, Homer and Turkey" (University of Amsterdam, 2013). Dörpfeld had identified this stage as Homeric Troy, but its apparent destruction by an earthquake does not agree with the realistic account of the sack of Troy in Greek tradition. The ancient city of Troy is the basis of Homer’s Iliad and site of the Trojan War. Troy was first excavated by Frank Calvert in 1863 CE and visited by Heinrich Schliemann who continued excavations from 1870 CE until his death in 1890 CE; in particular, he attacked the conspicuous 20 m high artificial mound which had been left untouched since antiquity. The idea that the city was Troy goes back at least 2,700 years, when the ancient Greeks were colonizing the west coast of Turkey. The ruins of Ancient Troy are found in current Hissarlik, Turkey, however, it was the Englishman, Charles Maclaren, who, in 1822, suggested that this might be the location of the city.

Homer’s Iliad is set in the 10th year of the siege and tells of the battle between Agamemnon and Achilles which led to the death in battle of Priam’s eldest son, Hector. Troy VI was destroyed by a violent earthquake a little after 1300 bce.

Paris, one of the 50 sons of wealthy King Priam was tasked by the Greek goddesses, Aphrodite, Hera and Athena to judge which of the three goddesses should receive the golden apple of Eris, the goddess of discord, which would define them as the most beautiful. Although the city was rebuilt it was soon abandoned for four hundred years. Troy at this time had new and vigorous settlers who introduced domesticated horses to the Aegean area. They built great palaces and developed a system of writing. The survivors of the earthquake quickly rebuilt the town, thus inaugurating the short-lived Troy VIIa. Returning to Troy from Çanakkale buses leave from 0930 until 1730. It takes more than a little imagination to figure out the centre of commerce that this must once have been.

Conflicts over the centuries between Mycenaeans and Hittites are more than probable and may well have been the origin of the epic Trojan War in Greek mythology. Ancient History Encyclopedia. Ancient Troy holds a unique position in history, literature and archaeology. Inhabited from the Early Bronze Age (3000 BCE) through to the 12th century CE the archaeological site which is now called Troy is 5 km from the coast but was once next to the sea. The site was situated in a bay created by the mouth of the river Skamanda and occupied a strategically important position between Aegean and Eastern civilizations by controlling the principal point of access to the Black Sea, Anatolia and the Balkans from both directions by land and sea. This ‘treasure’ includes 60 earrings, six bracelets, two magnificent diadems and 8750 rings, all in solid gold.
