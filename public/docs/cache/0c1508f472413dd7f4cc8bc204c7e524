They are strongly associated with those holding more "progressive" Adventist beliefs. The Protestant Reformation began as an attempt to reform the Catholic Church. <br> <br>After his death, his teachings on apostolic poverty gained currency among Arnoldists, and later more widely among Waldensians and the Spiritual Franciscans, though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation. <br> <br>Protestants refer to specific groupings of congregations or churches that share in common foundational doctrines and the name of their groups as denominations.

The so-called ‘Protestant vote’ was also held to be a significant factor in local politics. <br> Gradually, protestant became a general term, meaning any adherent of the Reformation in the German-speaking area. A prominent theologian in this group is Thomas Oden, a Methodist. <br> <br>The treaty also effectively ended the papacy's pan-European political power.

They invented nothing, either in technology or business management. Others appeared during the centuries following the Reformation and disappeared gradually with the time, such as much of Pietism. [44] The Reformation in Scotland culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along Reformed lines, and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France.

Methodism identifies principally with the theology of John Wesley—an Anglican priest and evangelist. <br> <br>[73] The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible, leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath. <br> <br>Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology (the doctrine of how the church as a body works), they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers, compared to the Catholics' idea that certain people within the church, or ideas that were old enough, had a special status in giving understanding of the text. <br> <br>However, because of their differences over the doctrines of divine predestination and election, many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other. Politically, Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. [196][197] The Geneva Convention, an important part of humanitarian international law, was largely the work of Henry Dunant, a reformed pietist.
