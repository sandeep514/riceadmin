But his experience with God in his dream allows him the opportunity to reconcile with his father from beyond the grave.Before my own father died, our last conversation was a very hostile argument. Mack goes to the shack, with reluctant curiosity. As Papa says (p.92): That’s why you’re here Mack … I want to heal the wound that has grown inside of you, and between us … Honey, there’s no easy answer that will take your pain away. The implication is that the Father suffered on the cross with Christ. It will undoubtedly help people forgive themselves and others. At every stage in the history of the Church, God’s people have been confronted with messages that claim to be a fresh insight into God’s truth or to revive lost insights. You wouldn’t guess that Mack is standing his ground well, as Sam Worthington’s (Mack) delivery feels so tired and insecure, while Octavia Spencer’s (Papa) is brimming with confident sass.                         9 a.m. • 10:45 a.m. Building Hours Mack goes to the shack, with reluctant curiosity. Delve deeper into some of the religious and spiritual aspects behind the Star Wars series. The Shack suggests that hierarchy of any form is the result of sin, and we will return to this claim in the section entitled The Shack on … Hierarchy and Authority. For, not only is “the Shack” openly Universalist (teaching through dialogue that all are saved) and New Age (teaching that god is in everyone and everything), but it deceptively presents the concept of the Hindu trinity (trimurti). This is exactly the sort of interaction a traumatized person might want to have with a God who claims to be all-powerful.In the end, however, Mack accepts, with disappointing ease, all of Papa’s answers about evil. History proves that all public-serving individuals eventually enjoyed protection and blessings from Heaven. Make a courageous and creative attempt to defend the ways of a transcendent God to men wounded by suffering and pain. Had I have known it was fiction at the outset, I then could have decided whether I wanted to read it or not. There are two passages in the book that could be understood to indicate this heretical view: a) The three became fully human – Papa says (p.99): When we three spoke ourself into existence as the Son of God, we became fully human. .

Guilt is man’s natural state because “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.”  (Isaiah 53:6)  Even if a person never read the Bible, his guilt would remain as long as he did not cry out to the Savior for forgiveness of sins. Nothing was left behind when he ascended.7 (emphasis added). While we would expect this kind of belief in the New Age, it is absolutely contradictory to biblical Christianity. Young agrees with mainstream Christian belief when he argues through Papa in the book that God is, “neither male nor female, even though both genders are derived from my nature” (p.93). I tried to tell her the error and tell her about Jesus and Mom said to me, that’s your God not my God, I don’t want to hear about Him. So, then, God’s remedy for our pain, according to The Shack, is not answers to our questions but a relationship of trust with Him. So what’s at the heart of many theologians’ rejection of The Shack? But when a book dealing with God and suffering proves so popular, it is important to know what the book says (as well as what it doesn't), and to consider how it might shape people's views of what Christianity is all about. These two issues alone (there are others) reveal Young’s heart and state of mind to me. Many people have defended their admiration for The Shack, saying it is “just a novel.” But Shack author William Paul Young admits that The Shack is more than a novel; he considers it a theological book: Please don’t misunderstand me; The Shack is theology.

The book paints a compelling picture of the warmth of God’s love for the reader and the possibility of intimacy in relationship with Him, and it strongly emphasises grace rather than legalistic religious observance as the basis of our relationship with God through Christ.

Eugene Peterson, Professor Emeritus of Spiritual Theology, Regent College, Vancouver, B.C. Is anyone else here old enough to remember the gilt-edged pages on new Bibles way back in the day? Mack’s relationship with men in general is the second theme that makes this movie worth watching. Not finding any leads as to who sent him the note, Mack decides to go to the shack and confront “Papa.” When he arrives, the shack is just as empty and dilapidated as he had left it in summer.
