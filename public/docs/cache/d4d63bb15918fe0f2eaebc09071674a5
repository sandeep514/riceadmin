NC (voiceover): God, don’t people talk anymore? As Hubie makes a proposal to Marina and gains her acceptance, Drake returns to finish the two off.

Rating The iconic quote from Hubie, "Goodness glaciers!" <br> <br>NC (voiceover): What hack songwriter wrote this, anyway? <br> <br>Drake: (singing) Say yes, my love, and go with a winner. (as Morgan Freeman) Here we see the penguin [Hubie] trying desperately to get a laugh. NC: In fact, let's put some blood in that scene and see how it looks. First star I see tonight. It's like saying, "I wanna figure out what the sounds smell like.". How do they keep finding all these ships? Narrator (Shani Wallis): There is a charming tradition observed by the Adelie Penguins. They make awkward small talk that's supposed to represent a relationship, as an evil penguin named Drake, played by Tim Curry, watches over them. He meets his end when, after trying to crush Hubie with a milestone, he accidentally causes the stadium to fall apart and collapse on top of him. <br> <br>Explore Wikis; Community Central; Start a Wiki; Search This wiki This wiki All wikis | Sign In Don't have an account?

The Pebble and the Penguin is a 1995 animated musical family comedy film, based on the true life mating rituals of the Adelie Penguins in Antarctica, produced and directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. I mean, Rocko, look. NC (voiceover): So Hubie and Rocko work out a plan to get themselves off the ship. (Drake drops Hubie into the water) So while in the water, he comes across the world’s FREAKING LARGEST SEAL! Country <br> <br>NC: That's The Pebble and The Penguin. It almost works. Caryn James of The New York Times wrote: "The tunes Mr. Manilow has written for the movie are, like his familiar pop standards, bouncy and catchy", and commented that "the animation is fine". But it seems to have saved the day. Take your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.  Only two scenes in the film were "augmented by computer animation" (one of which being "The Good Ship Misery" song sequence). <br> The Grinch vs. Did he fire six shots, or only five? (The caption "Shani Wallis" appears onscreen). Washington Post Staff Writer Hal Hinson wrote that "A flourishing opening number—titled 'Here and Now'—proves that Short can belt out a song with the best of them", adding that the "Bluth studio style of animation is passable, and, in the case of a Brecht-Weill flavored production number, occasionally inspired.". NC (voiceover): No, of course Rocko can fly now, breaking the laws of nature and gravity because... he ate a fairy, I don't know. Games Movies TV Video. CAN'T YOU JUST SPEAK FOR ONE MINUTE?! <br> <br> (The circle spins again to show another female penguin, Marina). NC (voiceover): (referring to Marina's tight-looking choker) Uh, is that choker trying to choke her? (sarcastically) Of course he did. All the elements are here, they just don't come together". Don Bluth and Gary Goldman were so dissatisfied with the final film that they left during production (to help set up Fox Animation Studios) and demanded to be uncredited as the directors. (Drake screams as he's crushed under a rock). NC: It’s weird, it’s sloppy, I have 20 minutes to waste. <br> <br> And not only are they bad, they're weird. is shown) Oh, the woman from Oliver! Deseret News said "the songs are forgettable, the story one-note and the characterizations quite weak". One night, Hubie and Marina manage to confirm how they feel for each other, but Hubie can't quite find a perfect pebble to propose to Marina with. NC (voiceover, as Drake): No! The script would only be a page long if they did that! <br> <br>		Budget Call me Rocko. It’s the penguins swimming and singing through the sheet music of the movie, which looks nice, but what the hell's the point of it? Martin Short as Hubie, a shy, good-hearted adelie penguin. NC: Is it wrong to say the muscle bound penguin sounds more credible? Rotten Tomatoes reported only 11% of critics gave positive reviews for "The Pebble and the Penguin" based on eight reviews with an average score of 3/10. <br> <br>	 <br> <br>Hubie (Martin Short) a shy, gullible but kindhearted penguin, is in love with the beautiful and kind Marina (Annie Golden), but lacks self-confidence leading him to be bullied by the much more impressive, but vain and cruel Drake (Tim Curry), who also wants Marina, but clearly for lust.  <br>	 The Spokesman-Review wrote "it is only an average effort in virtually every respect". SFGate said the "gnashing whale scenes are intense enough to push the G-rating envelope". You decided to lie to me! 142,284 Pages. Here we go! Seventy-five readers of San Antonio Express-News each won four tickets to see "The Pebble and the Penguin". <br> <br>NC (voiceover): Well, how do I put this? I see her face when I close my eyes! (normal) Oh, where was I? <br> <br>Hubie (singing): Sometimes I wonder what the colors mean. 		Written by (Rocko is mortified after hearing the lie). At the beginning of the film, he is seen spying on Hubie and Marina. Rocko: You're lost, and I'm looking at a dead penguin. I guess this means we put our differences on ice? I'm gonna take a bath for a minute. <br> <br>"The Pebble and the Penguin" opened at #13 at the box office, grossing $1,123,041 in its opening weekend with an average of $854. NC (voiceover): Meanwhile, at... (snickers as he sees Drake's lair, which appears to be obviously evil) Frankenberry's house, we see Drake continues to try and put the moves on Marina.  NC: Are they gonna go tap dancing through the script next, marking off all the bad lines they don’t like? 	 I'm the Nostalgia Critic.  I remember it so you don't have to. 	 The Animated Movie Guide said "considering the artistic and financial success of Disney's Beauty and the Beast, Don Bluth and Gary Goldman decided to cater to the dating crowd, in addition to preschoolers". <br> <br>Hubie: Waldo isn't real. <br> <br>In a 2001 edition of his magazine Toon Talk, Bluth admitted, "Penguin had story problems.

He forms a bond with Marina after showing her who he really is and she sees the real him. (kisses his "muscle"). Though Bluth Productions was based in Dublin, artists from Ireland, England and Hungary worked on the project, at least seven directing animators working on the film; among them John Pomeroy. NC (voiceover): Is it weird to say that during this song, all I'm thinking about is why penguins have hands? Pola is a female penguin from The Pebble and the Penguin.  Oh, I get it. Yet another strange and often clumsily animated film that wants to look nice as opposed to make any logical sense. (A picture from Oliver! NC (voiceover): Shani Wallis? <br> <br>	 The fisherman falls down and gets his head in a fish bucket). <br> <br>	 	 NC (voiceover): Well, after that 100% not-fakeout, we see that Drake has taken Marina to force her to be his bride. "Dirty" Harry Callahan (from Dirty Harry): (audio, dubbing over the seal) I know what you're thinking. When I hear the title The Pebble and the Penguin, this is what I expect to see. <br> <br>Now open your eyes! <br> <br>. To drag me through three thousand miles of water and killer whales! Her feat are a creamy peach-orange like Gwynne, Priscilla and Marina. Rocko reluctantly tells Hubie about his desire to fly.  (Hubie makes choking noises as Rocko strangles him. Rocko hands Hubie his pebble. The Austin Chronicle said: "The Pebble and the Penguin features some beautifully animated sequences [...] The characters are great and the voice talents of Martin Short...and James Belushi...are terrific". <br> <br>Take your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat. After seeing in a vision Marina having a dilemma, Hubie decides to escape. 	 Drake: (singing) Don't make me laugh! NC (voiceover): So because they... laughed for no apparent reason, I guess that means they're friends again. Rocko: You're either the greatest romantic hero of all time, or you're the stupidest penguin who ever lived! <br> <br>That's the law. Ha-ha-ha-ha! They have a short fight after Rocko tries to fly off "an authentic, ancient aviarial "airstrip" and another after Rocko saved Hubie from a killer whale. The Record said: "The orchestration is too fancy, too loud and often drowns out the lyrics. He's in love with a female penguin named Marina, played by Annie Golden. Unbelievably weird. So we go back to our heroes, who found a... very odd island of wood, as Hubie admits a sad secret that he's been keeping from Rocko. You're joking. <br> <br>The site added that in promotional material, the animators explained they "discovered that the land of snow and ice shines with many different hues". Rocko: No! Male penguins (singing): Now and forever, I'll show her I care. What did you think was going to happen, dumbass? In 1994, Bluth spoke enthusiastically of such pending projects as "The Pebble and the Penguin" and "A Troll in Central Park".  <br> <br>Who’s for busting out of here? Rocko: Captain! Rocko: (fighting Hubie) You! He presents it to Marina, who loves it, but loves Hubie more. Our attorneys advise you to stop ripping off Disney or we'll sue you for the little that you have. NC (voiceover): Uh, why don't you figure out what that lyric means first? and the Legend of the Vampire, Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, The Little Polar Bear: Lars and the Little Tiger, The Little Polar Bear: The Dream of Flying, The Little Polar Bear: A Visitor from the South Pole, https://warnerbros.fandom.com/wiki/The_Pebble_and_the_Penguin?oldid=124260. The Pebble and the Penguin 	 My conveniently shaped location! And, in what is perhaps the last great medium for musicals, the perfunctoriness of Barry Manilow's songs and arrangements seem guaranteed to put off yet another generation". <br> <br>	 When Hubie got the pebble he cruelly tripped him. (Illustrations of Hubie doing so are shown.) The endless musical of West Ice Story can fucking continue!  It just gets lost in the generic story and those few really weird turns that either work to Bluth's advantage or don't, and in this case, they don't. Hubie: I... Rocko, there's something you should know. <br> <br>Narrator: The rookery buzzed with excitement. <br> <br>(A Photoshopped picture of The Penguin from Batman Returns and Pebbles from The Flintstones is shown). During the rescue, Rocko's dream for flight comes true.
