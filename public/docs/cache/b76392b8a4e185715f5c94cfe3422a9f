Ozcelik intimately examines her protagonist’s slow descent into madness as she presents a microcosm of modern secular Turkish youth’s political displacement in a country that not only seems to have no use for them, but is actively trying to suppress their free thought. While Kirmizigul’s film sympathizes with some of the outdated patriarchal norms—his character’s obsession with having a boy after being disappointed by a slew of female children is seen as charming—he also shows some surprising social tolerance for such a folksy product, mainly in the form of a sympathetic depiction of a trans supporting character (Cemal Toktas).
