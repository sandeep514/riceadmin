Light is sent to detention after confronting bully Kenny Doyle harassing cheerleader Mia Sutton, and there meets the death god Ryuk, the notebook's owner. Asian Food Light flees, telling Mia to meet him at the Seattle Great Wheel. Interviews with leading film and TV creators about their process and craft. Mia meets Light at the wheel, and they ride to the top. On March 22, 2017, Netflix released a teaser of the film on YouTube. 17.7k Followers, 377 Following, 211 Posts - See Instagram photos and videos from Adam Wingard (@adamwingard) Now, it seems Death Note has hit an official wall with Netflix, and there is no telling how the franchise's creators reacted to the whole kerfuffle. [37] Brian Tallerico for Rogerebert.com gave the film one of four stars, stating that the changes that Wingard had made from the original work did not serve any artistic or thematic purpose, nor captured the cat-and-mouse game between Light and L that was core to the original work, and because the producers "refused to make Light the antihero he needed to be", the addition of Mia as a love interest "[left] the project hollow at its center", but mainly praised the performances of Stanfield and Dafoe. Wingard’s movie is based on the popular anime and manga series that involves a powerful book that will kill anyone whose name is written within it. [40], In an interview with Heat Vision, director Adam Wingard stated that Netflix had wanted to make at least two films, if enough people watch the first one. "Ultimately, if we tried to do something that was exactly the same, it would have been a jumbled mess. “I made my peace with the fact that we’re never going to win those fans over, that there’s going to be people who are just not going to like that the movie exists at all,” said Wingard. In 2007, the Malaysian newspaper The Star stated that more than ten film companies in the United States had expressed interest in the Death Note franchise. "We were very forthright with every script we would send to them and cuts of the film. "[41], On August 22, 2018, it was announced through a THR report that a sequel was in the works, with Greg Russo reportedly writing the script, after Sarandos called the film a "sizable" success. [21] On June 30, 2016, it was announced that Paul Nakauchi and Shea Whigham had joined the cast. In his review of the film, IndieWire’s David Ehrlich wrote of the whitewashing: “In this case, it pointed toward an inability or unwillingness to meaningfully engage with the source material.”, That blatant disregard for the material, while fans couldn’t have known it then, is likely what earned Wingard such vitriol. By creating an account, you verify that you are at least 13 years of age, and have read and agree to the Comicbook.com Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, By Megan Peters Both the rail operator and survivors have criticized this as disrespectful to the victims. "[18], Wingard addressed the concerns over the film, explaining that the film is an American take on the Death Note story, stating, "It's one of those things where the harder I tried to stay 100 percent true to the source material, the more it just kind of fell apart... You're in a different country, you're in a different kind of environment, and you're trying to also summarize a sprawling series into a two-hour-long film. At school, Light shows Mia the book, and demonstrates by killing a known criminal felon during a televised hostage situation. [38], Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, the original creators of Death Note, have praised the film, with the former stating, "In a good way, it both followed and diverged from the original work so the film can be enjoyed, of course by not only the fans, but also by a much larger and wider audience". The film was screened at FrightFest in London,[29][30][31] before being released on Netflix on August 25, 2017. Death Note is a 2017 American neo-noir supernatural thriller  film loosely adapted from the Japanese manga of the same name  created by Tsugumi Ohba  and Takeshi Obata. Asia Culture News [3] The American production company Vertigo Entertainment was originally set to develop the remake, with Charley and Vlas Parlapanides as screenwriters and Roy Lee, Doug Davison, Dan Lin, and Brian Witten as producers. Adam Wingard knew he was taking on a hot property when he signed on to direct an adaptation of Tsugumi Ohba’s “Death Note”  — the online death threats were an early indicator. That night, Light tries it again, using the name of his mother's killer, Anthony Skomal, and learns the next morning from his father James, a police detective, that Skomal died as Light had written. Adam Wingard was with Death Note when it initially was set up at Warner Bros. Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news! Recently, a resurfaced interview with Death Note director Adam Wingard has reminded fans of the little-known fact. On April 27, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Adam Wingard would direct the film, that Lin, Lee, Jason Hoffs and Masi Oka would produce, and that Niija Kuykendall and Nik Mavinkurve would oversee the studio. The wheel collapses, sending Mia falling to her death, while Light and the notebook fall into the nearby waters. [39], A few months after release, it was discovered that the images of the train accident in the movie were real footage of a 2010 train collision in Buizingen, Belgium in which 19 people died. “The good thing about those monster movies is that they do all feel like auteur pieces in a lot of ways…I definitely expect to give my stamp on it.”. “Rule 1.

Asian-American News Tension between Wingard and his critics appear to have escalated when the director fired back at “trolls,” as seen in screenshots saved by netizens: It’s difficult to point the exact origin of the online brawl, but it’s no secret that “Death Note” has caused controversy since whitewashing allegations made headlines. Black opposed this change, and it had not been green-lit. [12] In April 2016, TheWrap reported that because Warner Bros. had decided to make fewer films, the studio put the film into turnaround but allowed Wingard to take the project elsewhere. Clearly, the creators were fine with the changes, but anime purists were not thrilled by the film's Western relocation. For one, it scored a “rotten” 39% on Rotten Tomatoes. Hopefully people will watch it and Netflix will order a sequel. Asia Travel [4] On April 30, 2009, Variety reported that Warner Bros., the distributors for the original Japanese live-action films, had acquired the rights for an American remake, with the original screenwriters and producers still attached. Production officially began in British Columbia on June 30, 2016, (where Vancouver doubled as Seattle) overseen by DN (Canada) Productions, Inc.[14][15][16][17][18] Atticus Ross and Leopold Ross composed the score for the film.
