Luka is the third youngest player ever to make the All-NBA first team, however, that is solely because the 2020 season was delayed. </p> <p>Well, it is safe to say he shattered everyone’s expectations.

In addition to being a first-round fantasy staple in just his sophomore season, Doncic has broken several records as the youngest player to reach several benchmarks at such a young age. </p> <p> Unlike the three previous MVPs, however, Giannis was a significant benefit to his team on the defensive end as well as the offensive end. Lebron doesn’t force his 3s though as much. It's unprecedented. Additionally, many people thought the award should have been given to James Harden. He's put the Mavericks in a position to get back to the playoffs for the first time in four years, and he's certainly a heavy favorite to make the All-Star team after narrowly missing out his rookie season. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:24:"luka doncic season stats";s:5:"links";s:9322:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/best-steelhead-bead-colors-86e6ec'>Best Steelhead Bead Colors</a>,
