The last third raises serious doubts about Nick's artistry as he stages a dream sequence involving Tito (Peter Dinklage), a dwarf in powder-blue formal dress. Overall, Living In Oblivion is a great film. The movie plays around with reality and dreams without getting too obscure or serious. Very funny film about the hazards of independent film making, One of the most entertaining films about film-making ever made. Tom DiCillo's wit and humor are outrageous in the best sense. TimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers. 710067). Superbly acted by the entire cast, especially Buscemi, Keener, Martens, and Mulrony, the movie is full of twists and turns that keep you longing for more. This must be one of those movies only people involved in the industry can really find entertaining. A valentine to the independent film world, DiCillo's version of Truffaut's Night for Day offers a smart, amusing look at the perils of low-budget filmmaking; the ensemble acting is superb. While the film is funny it is so close to the bone that I was initially surprised to see it appear in the comedy section. Steve Buscemi may or may not have been the first choice by writer/director Tom DiCillo for the lead role of Nick, the director behind the three (err, one) film(s) being made within the film Living in Oblivion, but it works so well it's impossible to see anyone else in the role. Whether they crave love, glory (an award "for the best film ever made by a human being") or just lunch, all of them have somehow put their faith in film making. We see that day in the form of dream sequences from the point of view of the lead actress and the director. I wrote the first half hour in 4 days.”  The time in which DiCillo released the film was very popular for independent filmmakers and it had such great success because it was a relatable issue for the up and coming filmmakers that had just graduated film school. the hipper-than-thou Chad declares on his arrival. A pure, a true enjoyment. Am I alone here? A hip indie version of Truffaut's Day for Night, Living in Oblivion celebrates the very act of filmmaking as grand folly, a triumph of absurdist heroism. While he nominally presents the directing process as a series of hellish travails, Mr. DiCillo captures such delicious mischief that his indictment becomes a valentine. The Sundance film festival award winning comedy film depicts the process of making an independent/student film quite cleverly. In a perfect coda, Mr. DiCillo shows just which longings each of his characters entertain. The movie is full of well-used and perfectly-placed profanity. The film divides itself into three segments, the best of which is the central episode featuring Chad. I've seen it more than 3 times and its humor holds through each viewing. Keener in particular has a tough role repeating the same scene over and over again and giving it tiny nuances and changes. Ultimate tribute to all independent filmmakers. Let's just say that Mr. DiCillo is current enough to make sure the answer involves Quentin Tarantino. One problem with its structure, though, is the repeated "dream trick." Living in Oblivion Review. So why is he wreaking havoc on Nick's little set? This is apparently the last film she was in and I really have to wonder why. It wasn't too long and at the end I was craving more of it. For the cast and crew of the film within this film, the downs hilariously outnumber the ups. See the article in its original context from. The plot goes nowhere and the characters are so stupid that I lost interest about five minutes into it. Writer-director Tom DiCillo made in 1991 a film called "Johnny Suede" starring a young and unknown at the time actor named Brad Pitt. ( Log Out /  If you've got the stomach for good, solid funny times with lots of 'off'  words, this one will do it for you. I stood this for 41:33---root canal is more bearable than this gruesomely predictable time- waster from the indie psycho ward. Naturally, this bombed...it was TOO intelligent for mainstream audiences and how do you market a film like this. Its first use creates shock and interest, but its second use creates a serious distraction in the third act since the viewer keeps wondering whose dream he or she may be in this time. ), I just thought he was boring and irritating. I have absolutely no idea why this jewel isn't known by more people. It only took sixteen days to shoot Living In Oblivion. Sluggish, dumbly overpraised farce about an indie movie I would never see, but I still might pick over this one. The film veers from satire to realism to surrealism in depicting the problems and tensions involved in off-off-Hollywood filmmaking. 				Change ). buscemi at his best…, Brilliant! The film takes the audience through take after take and scene after scene, cluttering it with interjected dreams of the cast and crew, with little purpose or entertainment power. More hipster junk from the indie dumpster, Among Spinal Tap and The Commitments as a Personal Fav. If you want to waste an hour and a half of your life...this movie is for you. By Steven Rea (14,229) for  Philadelphia Inquirer (26,369) on 16 Nov 2014, By Rob Gonsalves (1,035) for  eFilmCritic.com (5,369) on 08 Apr 2007, By Mick Lasalle (18,215) for  San Francisco Chronicle (37,050) on 17 Jul 2004, By Owen Gleiberman (15,809) for  Entertainment Weekly (37,282) on 06 Sep 2011, By Desson Thomson (7,831) for  Washington Post (46,253) on 01 Dec 2003. The subject matter may be narrow and in-jokey, but the finished film is broadened by infectious good humor, not to mention delightful ensemble acting that keeps its energy high. FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW: LIVING IN OBLIVION; A Valentine to the Perils of Film Making. Create a free website or blog at WordPress.com. What I mean to say is that it has to say something new about something we thought we'd made up our minds about, namely the thing that's being satirized. The lead performances by Steve Buscemi and Catherine Keener are first-rate, and the supporting cast is excellent as well.  Living in Oblivion is an unusual, funny, and interesting example of the movie-about-movies genre, focusing on the low budget, independent movie making scene. Then, leading man (Le Gros) flexes a few megastar muscles. For all of us who have worked on a film production before, watching Living in Oblivion is an honor and an enjoyment. Overall, this is a low budget film that is well written and has a good cast of talented but less famous actors. There's nothing new about seeing a shot go fuzzy or a sound boom lurch comically into a close-up, but Mr. DiCillo turns the sheer accumulation of such screw-ups into something maddeningly funny. Lacking the story content and character depth of other DiCillo films, "Living..." should be filed under "Last to watch" and will be of more interest to film buffs than the public at large. In other words, nobody watched it. I wonder if that was completely intentional or the director chose to cast an irritating actor. I'm not saying the movie's perfect, cause I don't think it is, but it should definitely get more recognition that it does. Funny and interesting, if convoluted, movie-about-movie. This is one of my favorite movies and it aggravates me that it's the kind of movie that always seems to slip through the cracks. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them. But on a no-budget film the “unhappy accidents” can drop you to your knees. A hip indie version of Truffaut's Day for Night, Living in Oblivion celebrates the very act of filmmaking as grand folly, a triumph of absurdist heroism. Copyright © Fandango. Writer-director Tom Dicillo takes a satiric look at independent films while capturing the ups and downs of making a movie. She did a fantastic job in this one. But it plays on IFC all the time and it's basically one of the best films of its year and one of the best on the art of films and filmmaking. Painful for any filmmaker, but brilliant…, I don't know why this has such a cult following. The movie is completely stolen by Le Gros' womanising Hollywood egomaniac who insists on ad-libbing, altering the script and, in a perfect moment of cinematic in-jokery, informing Buscemi that the only reason he's doing the movie is because "someone said you were tight with Tarantino". And film making this liberating may just answer their prayers. I love this business but at times it really does feel that the entire process of making a film is designed to drive you into an insane asylum. Pretty much the whole cast does a great job. Every time I tell someone I didn't like this movie, they say, "Well you just don't like independent films." External Reviews The result is Living In Oblivion: simultaneously a howl of rage against the restrictions of low-budget movie-making and a celebration of how, sometimes, things … AN inspired choice opens this year's New Directors/New Films series tonight: "Living in Oblivion," Tom DiCillo's wonderfully funny behind-the-scenes look at the perils of film making, no-budget style. I thought it was super lame…, Filme em construção, meta-filme ou crónica de uma produção falhada: Living in Oblivion encaixa em cada uma dessas categorias, mas não…, Overrated. Divided in three acts, each representing a different scene to shoot, this film is an essential for amateur filmmakers. (C). Read honest and unbiased product reviews from our users. Beware, however. Not nearly as funny as I'd expected, LIVING IN OBLIVION seems too geared towards people who are actually involved in making independent films.
