With 10 minutes of normal time remaining Arsenal extended their lead, when Ljungberg scored. Edu has at last showed what he is capable for and IMO will be one of the stars in the new season. Sidwell, Jerome Thomas and also look really good players but my understanding is that they are on loan with Baveren. Here are my views on our 2002-2003 squad : At the moment, Seaman is the best English goalkeeper in the country by a mile and there is no doubt that he will start the season. [40] The scare brought Chelsea to life and resulted in the team enjoying their best spell of the match.                                             €-67.35m. His goal scoring ratio is absolutely fantastic (86 in 142 matches ?) An uneventful tie, with Carlo Cudicini making a series of saves to deny Norwich finished goalless and was replayed at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal also upped the tempo whenever they could, making it difficult for United to settle into a regular rhythm. can a player really make that much difference ?                                                                                  [17], The most recent meeting between the two teams was in the Premier League on Boxing Day, when Arsenal came from behind to beat Chelsea. He had a good rest and no injuries (keep fingers crossed) and just watch him go; shame about the lack of European travels. The Londoners finally tested the United rearguard three minutes after the interval when Wiltord's cross almost found Edu, but the Brazilian's stretch was in vain. We need to find that consistency and if we can do that, I believe we will be up there with them soon. He is basically someone that we have been looking for to protect the defence and therefore allow Vieira the freedom to go forward a lot more as he used while Petit was with us. [47] Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. [8] An own goal by Middlesbrough's Gianluca Festa, from an Henry free-kick, was enough for Arsenal to win the semi-final. Can you imagine if we are leading the table then we have Pires, Freddie and Gio to return ? [39] Four minutes later Vieira started a move which almost gave Arsenal the lead. [42] His effort went over a diving Cudicini, into the top right-hand corner of the Chelsea goal. Arsenal Football Club Highbury House 75 Drayton Park London, N5 1BU. We obviously have to start we Bergkamp and Henry. Ranieri described the match against Arsenal as evenly balanced, adding: "Winning the FA Cup would make up for missing out on the Champions League. "[4] Gifton Noel-Williams moments later halved the scoreline, heading the ball in from a Gary Fisken cross. [57] The cup final ratings, a record low, were defended by the FA spokesman Paul Newman: "We are very pleased because the final peaked at 7.4m which is pretty good for a hot Saturday in the middle of a bank holiday weekend. And we will do it. [19] Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was buoyant his team would complete the task on hand: "We have been facing cup games in the league every week for a long time and this is just another. [14] The visitors started well and took the lead in the sixth minute through Richard Cresswell. Squad of Arsenal FC . and if Jeffers gets back to full fitness then I really see a few more trophies coming to Highbury next season. [58], Four days later Arsenal defeated Manchester United to complete their third double in the club's history. Wiltord is of course another option but I prefer him on the right of midfield. [37] Ljungberg was serenaded by the Arsenal crowd, who chanted "We love you Freddie, 'cos you've got red hair. Toure – what a match he had v Munich; bring him on, that is all I have to say ! "[36] The teamsheets showed Gallas partnering Marcel Desailly in central defence, and Hasselbaink starting up front for Chelsea. [42] Chelsea made their second change in the 67th minute, bringing on Zola for Hasselbaink. Both teams won their semi-final match by a single goal. [39] Wiltord then collected the ball from midfield and played a one-two with Henry, but directed his shot wide from the left flank. This was partly because the Premier League chose to end its campaign a week later, but with the World Cup starting on 31 May, the FA wanted to give players considerable time to prepare for the finals. [39] Campbell's failed clearance a minute later presented Guðjohnsen with goal-scoring opportunity, but he hit his shot directly at Seaman. Volz is another player who seems to be comfortable at either right back or right side of midfield and had a great match last v England and also captained Germany U-19 to the final. Part of Arsenal's plan involved Edu keeping a weather eye open for the forward runs of Roy Keane while Patrick Vieira watched Juan Sebastian Veron. [50], Henry Winter's match report in The Daily Telegraph, 5 May 2002[44], Journalists and pundits reviewing the final unanimously agreed with the outcome of the match. [59] Arsenal paraded both trophies on an open-top bus once the season drew to a close; Dixon at Islington Town Hall addressed the crowd and personally thanked his staff, teammates and the club supporters. Lets just say that I disagree with them and I hope that he will sign a new contract because it will be a great shame if we lose such a great player. Otherwise United were left to maintain some sort of attacking momentum, that is until Arsenal went ahead four minutes before the hour. Historical neatness demanded that Wenger's team finish the job without delay. The team finished the tie as comfortable 4–0 winners, never looking as though they would crumble once William Gallas scored inside 12 minutes. "[47] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: "This team knows how to win. and he loves the club. I have noticed that Vieira still has a few critics. Arsenal withstood the pressure and took the lead in the 70th minute, when Ray Parlour scored from 25 yards. Box office boxoffice@arsenal.co.uk. Please click the button "Send inquiry" which opens a new e-mail message. The FA Cup is English football's primary cup competition. After an uneventful first half, Chelsea settled much the quicker of the two and created several chances to score. Parlour, meanwhile, looked ready to take on anybody. "[58] A list compiled by the London Evening Standard showed the 2002 final came bottom in the season's top 10 viewed football matches. After overcoming replays in the first two rounds and a difficult tie against Preston North End, Chelsea recorded an impressive win against Tottenham Hotspur. Please add the homepage on which the squad is supposed to be embedded. [13], In the fifth round Chelsea played Preston North End at home. And how about Parlour ? Contact us. Although he agreed with the media consensus that the final was a drab affair and Arsenal's performance was not to their standard, he picked out several high-quality moments that the losing finalists failed to match, one in particular a timed-ball from Vieira. The squad overview can be embedded on the own homepage via iframe. First a 20-yard shot from Paul Scholes then a close-range header from Wes Brown took deflections on their way wide and high. The retiring champions were well below their best. My Arsenal player for the future is definitely David Bentley who I believe will become our new “Brady”. "[53], The match was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by both the BBC and Sky Sports, with BBC One providing the free-to-air coverage and Sky Sports 2 being the pay-TV alternative. Some of United's tackling, like their championship challenge this season, was becoming a little late, although the fact that Edu did not see a card until he fouled Mikael Silvestre in the 41st minute was a mystery in itself. Arse nal's attack was also without the injured Thierry Henry but Ray Parlour and Fredrik Ljungberg had won them the FA Cup at the weekend so why worry ? With all our young players also waiting for their opportunities I feel optimistic but please control yourselves and keep your fingers crossed. My view is that Taylor has potential but still a long way from a number 1 position. [27] Finalists stood to receive £1 million in prize money; the winners would pocket an extra million with additional TV revenues. [39] The opening half-hour was mostly event-free, with neither side dominating and few goalscoring opportunities fashioned. Earlier, Edu himself had been fortunate to escape a booking for a rough tackle on Keane. They took the lead in the eighth minute, where good play by Nwankwo Kanu allowed Thierry Henry to round goalkeeper Alec Chamberlain and tap the ball into the empty goal. Pennant must be given lots of chances. Classic Chelsea. [44] Riley blew for full-time after normal and stoppage time and the on-pitch interviews commenced. Please click the button "Send inquiry" which opens a new e-mail message. [37] Both teams lined up in a 4–4–2 formation: a four-man defence (comprising two centre-backs and left and right full-backs), four midfielders (two in the centre, and one on each wing) and two centre-forwards. I amazed that people still criticise Henry, one of the most gifted players ever at Arsenal. Arsenal won the league away to Manchester United at Old Trafford  on 8 May 2002; the winning goal was scored by Sylvain Wiltordin the second half. [42] The substitution did not have the desired effect as Arsenal went a goal ahead. [54] BBC One held the majority of the viewership, with an overnight peak audience of 7.4 million viewers – it received a final rating of 8.3 million. A draw would have been enough to end Manchester United's latest reign as champions but in the event Arsenal took the lead with a goal from Sylvain Wiltord just before the hour. [4] After squandering numerous chances to increase their lead, Arsenal added a late third and fourth goal from Kanu and Dennis Bergkamp, before Marcus Gayle scored what was a mere consolation for Watford in stoppage time. "[20] When asked what he made of Sir Alex Ferguson's comments that Manchester United played the best football in England, Wenger retorted: "What do you want me to say? [39] A confrontation between Melchiot and Freddie Ljungberg occurred in the 33rd minute, but referee Mike Riley decided not to brandish a card, instead choosing to have a few words with the players. When Wenger first arrived at Highbury, the so-called experts were saying that Arsenal would be on their way down because the famous back 5 (actually 6) of Seaman, Dixon, Winterburn, Bould, Adams, and Keown had finished and would never be replaced. There are rumours that he is due to sign a new 5 year contract, so great news if its true. Forssell then scored Chelsea's third to settle the home side's nerves. It was the second meeting between both teams in a week, and in spite of Arsenal winning the first fixture and scoring the opener in the cup tie, Newcastle held them to a 1–1 draw. Arsenal were appearing in their fifteenth final to Chelsea's seventh. What separates the good goalkeepers from the great goalkeepers is the least number of mistakes that are made and Dave has made very few mistakes at the very top level. He was outstanding for England U-19 last week. They had won their seventh championship in 1953, Coronation year, so why not their 12th at the home of Coronation Street and in Jubilee year to boot? Not that United are ever likely to want other people's street parties on their patch. Matches up to the semi-final were contested on a one-off basis, with a replay taking place if the match ended in a draw. [39] A clash between Henry and Terry in the 75th minute resulted in both players receiving a yellow card for unsporting behaviour. [30], For their pre-match walkabout, the Arsenal players wore Hugo Boss suits, whereas the Chelsea players were suited in Armani. Almost immediately Ferguson replaced Veron with Van Nistelrooy, who quickly entered into the spirit of things by indulging in a spot of push-and-shove with Martin Keown.
