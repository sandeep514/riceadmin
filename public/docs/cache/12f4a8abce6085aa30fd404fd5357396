Super Rugby Stats 2020 SUPER RUGBY (REVISED) Super Rugby Unlocked View archives. Your email address will not be published. Super Rugby crowds are in decline in South Africa and Australia, but what about New Zealand? Add Fixtures to Calendar. More than 60 per cent of a stadium was empty, and there is only so much creative camera angles can do to make that appear full. All times shown are your local time Download Super Rugby eCal. Brumbies 2020 Super Rugby Crowd. The DHL Stormers delivered an improved second half performance to grab a 23-17 comeback win over the Emirates Lions in their second round Vodacom Super Rugby Unlocked match at DHL Newlands in Cape Town on Saturday evening. The obvious downside is that parents are more reluctant to take their young children to night time games because it will mean a late night for them, whereas afternoon kickoffs are more convenient. The next best was the Stormers, with their massive average crowd of 28,700 taking up just 55.3 per cent of Newlands Stadium in Cape Town. In England, stadiums average 75.75 per cent capacity. This, again, plays into the idea of perception versus reality. Brumbies vs Rebels 2020 Attendance 7,098 (Brumbies 39-26 Rebels on 7 February, 2020) Round 1 Round 2 Round 3 Round 4 Round 5 Round 6 Round 7. Westpac Stadium was 48.99 per cent full, Forsyth Barr was 47.97 per cent full and Eden Park was just 26.26 per cent full during your average week of the 2017 Super Rugby season. The Aviva Premiership, meanwhile, averaged about 375,000 viewers per game for the 2016-17 season, the most it had gained since BT Sport took over coverage of the competition. In 2019, the Waratahs’ average attendance was 13,069 – the most of any Australian franchise. Only the Highlanders saw crowds decline in that period, down from an average of 18,500 in 2015 to 14,751 in 2017 - a drop of 20.26 per cent. The Pro14, which includes Italy, Ireland, and now a pair of South African teams, had an increase of one per cent. Take Pau, the club Conrad Smith and Colin Slade recently played for, based in the Pyrenees. The Hurricanes get 3.35 per cent of the Wellington regional population along on match day, while the Chiefs (2.94 per cent) and Crusaders (2.68 per cent) aren't far off. But there is a split between New Zealand and our Sanzaar brothers, Australia and South Africa. It's the motivation to watch in person has gone. Rugby has traditionally been a winter sport and when most of the games are scheduled to kick off at 7.35pm at night, it's difficult for the stadiums to convince people to leave the warmth of their homes or pubs/bars to come down, brave the cold and support their teams. Essentially, more than 10 per cent of the local population is turning out to each Pau home game. Crowd figures from 2017 highlight the difference between perception and reality when it comes to attendances for Super Rugby sides over the past four years. The Cheetahs battled their way to a close-fought 19-17 win over the Bulls in their second round Vodacom Super Rugby Unlocked clash in Bloemfontein. Blues crowds were up 18.27 per cent, an extra 2000 people each night. To start, Super Rugby's average attendance as a whole is in sharp decline.

Last updated after Brumbies v Highlanders (Attendance 7,270) on 15 Feb, 2020, Brumbies vs Reds 2020 attendance 7,436 (Brumbies 27-24 Reds on 31 January, 2020) Meanwhile, the Crusaders' home match against the Chiefs has already sold 11,000 tickets - well over half of Christchurch's Orangetheory Stadium's capacity of 17,400. Just over 1000 seats are spare, and they'd be hard to spot. The evening kickoff is commonplace as Europe and South Africa are big target audiences and these kick off times happen to be at decent hours over there. The ability to score tries from all facets of the game is important but one part of the game seems to be dominating... and who does it best? SANZAAR has announced that The Rugby Championship 2020 will be played in Australia, in November and December this year. 01 Oct 2020 Unlocking Super Rugby … (Photo by Brendon Thorne/Getty Images), In addition to stadium attendance declining, TV viewing numbers are also down.

Figures supplied show that a total of 105,323 tickets were sold for the opening four matches, an average attendance of 26,330 per match. South Africa led the way at 26,625,585, which is understandable given their population base, but disappointing was Australia which had just 4,236,000 viewers for Super Rugby. Finally, one of the biggest reasons for the decline in attendance is the Super Rugby competition itself. At that level, the Blues have the fourth-emptiest stadium of teams in the top four leagues, as Super Rugby sides take up the bottom nine spots. 2020 Super Rugby AU; 2020 Super Rugby Aotearoa; 2020 Super Rugby; 2019 Super Rugby; The Blues and Highlanders will clash in Auckland with crowds now able to attend due to the imminent Level 1 move. The Bulls and Jaguares couldn't fill 20 per cent of their stadiums, while the Kings were 20.49 per cent full in 2017. Rugby crowds have more than doubled since the post-Covid resumption, with the average attendance from the opening two rounds of the new Super Rugby Aotearoa competition sitting at more than 26,000, according to Stuff. You'd be lucky to see a stadium even half full. The Pumas gave notice of their Super Rugby Unlocked potential with an impressive 27-21 win over the Griquas in Kimberley on Saturday. In France, that number is 73.5 per cent, and in the Pro14 it's 62.17 per cent.

In 2015, the average crowd size across the competition was 19,163, making it easily the world's biggest rugby competition by average attendance. With a stadium seating 18,000, you could say Pau struggle to fill their Stade du Hameau home, but when you consider the surrounding population those figures are mighty impressive. They have an average crowd of 11,646, and a population in the Tokyo metropolitan area of 38 million. It is the third tournament in its current 15 team format, the last before the Japanese side the Sunwolves  withdraw from the tournament ahead of a new format in 2021.

Last year, that overall average had dropped to just 14,436, a 24.67 per cent drop in attendance in just two years, and brings Super Rugby back to the chasing pack. I also think that it allows those who wish to watch the game on TV the freedom to do what they want throughout the day and then sit back, relax and watch the rugby after dinner.

The Waratahs recorded their lowest ever crowd attendance on Saturday night, as they went down to the Blues in Newcastle. The conference format means an increase in local "derbies" which were usually well attended at first but now even they are struggling to attract people.

All four clubs are in the top 20 in world rugby for attracting people to their games, with the Brumbies (2.45 per cent) the only other side to make that list. Taking into account the rest of Otago as well, they still attract 6.58 per cent of the regional population, which is almost double that of their nearest Super Rugby rivals, the Hurricanes. Surprisingly, the team with the highest average attendance in world rugby is the Stormers, who had 28,700 through the gates on average last year. Waratahs fans wait before kick off against the Blues in Newcastle. Brumbies vs Reds 2020 attendance 7,436 (Brumbies 27-24 Reds on 31 January, 2020) Brumbies vs Rebels 2020 Attendance 7,098 (Brumbies 39-26 Rebels on 7 February, 2020) Brumbies vs Highlanders 2020 Attendance 7,270 (ACT 22-23 Otago on 15 February, 2020) Sunwolves SR 2020 Crowd The Reds ended the regular Super Rugby AU season in fine style by overcoming leaders Brumbies 26-7 at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane on Saturday.
