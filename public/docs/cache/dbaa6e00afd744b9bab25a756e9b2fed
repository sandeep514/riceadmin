And indeed it is the rare Broadway show that attempts to portray gangsters as something other than secretly good-hearted slobs.  For this Broadway production first seen earlier this year at New Jersey’s Paper Mill Playhouse, the co-directors are DeNiro and Jerry Zaks (who staged the original solo version), with Palminteri as the book writer. Brooks as Sonny is intimidating yet charming, and he is clearly the standout. Directed by Robert De Niro and Jerry Zaks, A Bronx Tale is based on the book and one-man show by Chazz Palminteri with music by Alan Menken & Glenn Slater. "Joe Dziemianowicz for New York Daily News, "Aside from Machiavelli-quoting mobster Bobby—played with expertly calibrated swagger by Nick Cordero—none of the characters command interest, and Alan Menken and Glenn Slater’s doo-wop–heavy score is far too lightweight for a plot that features murders and racial hate crimes. A Bronx Tale is a musical based on the play by the same name with a book by Chazz Palminteri, music by Alan Menken, and lyrics by Glenn Slater. A Bronx Tale is a 1993 film directed by Robert De Niro, who plays the father of Calogero, an Italian-American boy who is torn between the world of organized crime and his father’s love.   Chazz Palminteri’s A Bronx Tale seems to have had more than nine lives. Costume designer: William Ivey Long Of course, this has made Lorenzo, Calogero’s father, very upset. The Hollywood Reporter, LLC is a subsidiary of Prometheus Global Media, LLC. Presented by Tommy Mottola, The Dodgers, Tribeca Productions, Evamere Entertainment, Neighborhood Fling, Jeffrey Sine, Cohen Private Ventures and Grant Johnson, in association with Paper Mill Playhouse. "Frank Scheck for Hollywood Reporter, "After the 1989 solo show, the 1993 movie directed by Robert De Niro and the 2007 Broadway production staged by Jerry Zaks, where else could this show go but back to Broadway as a musical starring Nick Cordero? Book: Chazz Palminteri To the best of our knowledge, “A Bronx Tale,” Chazz Palminteri’s love letter to the wise guys and tough street kids from his old neighborhood has not been re-imagined as a ballet, but given the popularity of this vintage material, that might very well be in the works. (Update: All shows have been canceled for the month of March.). This is a production that attempts to serve many masters, and the outcome is more jarring than it is synchronistic. It’s highly reminiscent of the De Niro film. The show stars Alec Nevin as Calogero, Jeff Brooks as Sonny, Trey Murphy as young Calogero, Anthony Gianni as young Calogero, Nick Fradiani as Lorenzo, Kayla Jenerson as Jane, Stefanie Londino as Rosina, George Vickers V as Tyrone, Martin Bonventre, Hallie Brevetti, Lauren Celentano, Tyler Dema, Bryan Dougherty, Harrison Drake, Adam Grabau, Mairys Joaquin, Breia Kelley, Christopher Miles, Brett Pederson, Jacob Roberts-Miller, Daniel Rosenbaum, Mark Sippel, Johanna Taylor, Joey Trombino, Darius Vines, Rhys Williams, and Nathan Wright.

Meanwhile, Beowulf Boritt’s smart scene design is full of towering fire escapes where various characters magically appear and then vanish.   External links to full reviews from popular press... New York Times - New York Daily News - Time Out - Hollywood Reporter - Variety. 'A Bronx Tale'... might be called the musical-theater equivalent of that classic comfort food. Lyrics: Glenn Sater The differences between the two mentors can be summed up by their respective philosophies: Lorenzo tells his son that “the saddest thing in life is wasted talent,” while Sonny declares, “The working man’s a sucker.”. Despite its by-now overfamiliarity, the piece achieves a new freshness in this entertaining musicalization, featuring a tuneful score by two Disney veterans — eight-time Oscar-winner Alan Menken (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin) and Glenn Slater (The Little Mermaid, Tangled), whose previous collaborations include the screen-to-stage musicals Sister Act and Leap of Faith.  But such is the case with A Bronx Tale, a winningly performed but losing-ly scripted musical based on a movie based on a one-man show based partially on actual events. There's no point giving a Bronx cheer to this formulaic but entertaining crowd-pleaser. by FACEBOOK It’s a fitting visual metaphor for a story about a boy who feels the heat as he tries to find the best way out of his childhood. It is the rare Broadway show that leaves its audience disturbed by gun violence and racial slurs even as they go happily humming doo-wop on their way out of the theater. A Bronx Tale is a 1993 film directed by Robert De … The semi-autobiographical tale revolves around Calogero (Bobby Conte Thornton), who as a 9-year-old witnesses a murder committed by his neighborhood’s reigning hoodlum, Sonny (Nick Cordero). Chazz Palminteri’s A Bronx Tale seems to have had more than nine lives. However, Nevin lays it on a bit too thick with the accent, and sometimes it’s hard to hear what he’s saying. A Bronx Tale The Musical, New York City: Address, Phone Number, A Bronx Tale The Musical Reviews: 4.5/5 In a less than satisfying conclusion, C’s choice of male role model is made for him and he gets the girl, but then ultimately forgets her. After the young boy refuses to finger him to the cops, the grateful gangster takes him under his wing, rewarding him handsomely for performing odd jobs. Cordero sings two of the best numbers: “Nicky Machiavelli,” featuring clever lyrics by Slater that amusingly detail Sonny’s survival methods as learned by the Italian Renaissance writer; and “One of the Great Ones,” a swinging, Sinatra-style number about unforgettable love stories. His first encounter with Sonny was shocking as it resulted in the mob boss killing someone on the streets. Even though it won’t have you memorizing the songs right off the bat, some of the songs are fun and are inspired by the Four Seasons group, doo-wop genre, etc. And with Jersey Boys about to close, they’ll be looking for another dose of outer-borough nostalgia. But such is the case with A Bronx Tale, a winningly performed but losing-ly scripted musical based on a movie based on a one-man show based partially on actual events.  It has a powerful message of love and family and how our environment can influence us. Real life outcomes temper Palminteri’s dramatic urges. All rights reserved. Cops came in for questioning and brought Calogero to pick the murderer out from a police lineup. Privacy | The kid almost stops the show with his solo number “I Like It,” in which he brags about feeling like the prince of the neighborhood. Though hardly sophisticated entertainment, A Bronx Tale has genuine charms that will likely appeal to, pardon the expression, the bridge-and-tunnel crowd. Terms of Use | While the score doesn’t feature any breakout songs, it is tuneful and fun, with Menken smartly incorporating period-perfect ‘50s doo-wop and ‘60s pop influences.

The opening number, “Belmont Avenue,” is a close cousin to Little Shop’s opener, “Skid Row,” here with four doo-wop singers instead of three street urchins providing the harmonies. Sitemap | This earned Sonny’s respect, and he takes Calogero under his wing. Although refreshingly brisk (it clocks in at just over two hours, including intermission), there are problems. But what happens if you take a project like A Bronx Tale and turn it into a musical? Next up: surely an opera. The odd couple directing duo of Jerry Zaks and Robert De Niro find many a mobsterly detail to keep the huge ensemble busy. "Sometimes plain old pasta with red sauce is just what the doctor ordered. In a cinematic piece of staging that will undoubtedly be stolen when someone decides to write Goodfellas, the Musical, we meet Sonny’s crew in a bar with the action pausing as each character poses for a mug shot while Sonny reels off his gangster nickname.  Frank Scheck If that wasn’t enough drama, Calogero grows up as a teenager and falls for Jane, a black teenager from another part of town.  As he is busy being pulled in both directions, he falls for Jane (Ariana Debose), the right girl with the wrong skin color. Deadly beatings compete with Sergio Trujillo’s lively dance numbers. Venue: Longacre Theatre, New York Nick Cordero, left, and Joshua Colley in “A Bronx Tale: The Musical.” Credit... Matthew Murphy. Not only is there the nearly satirical, “This is a Bronx tale,” repeatedly intoned throughout, Calogero’s ruminative song about interracial romance begins flatly, “In a world like this, where everything seems black and white, in a world like this, they’re so quick to tell you what’s wrong and what’s right.”. “Out of Your Head” is the love song with Jane and Calogero, and fans of Disney’s Hercules will be reminded of “I Won’t Say (I’m in Love),” which was also composed by Menken. Stephen Edlund is the tour director with Sergio Trujillo as choreographer, Brittany Conigath as Tour Choreographer, Ron Melrose as music supervisor/arrangements, Beowulf Boritt as scenic designer, William Ivey Long as costume designer, Howell Binkley as lighting designer, Gareth Owen as sound designer, Paul Huntley as hair & wig designer, Anne Ford-Coates as makeup designer, Robert Westley as fight coordinator, Doug Besterman as orchestrations, David Aaron Brown as music conductor, Johnny Gale as period music consultant, and John Mezzio as music coordinator. Young C, as he is called, faces the basic Shakespearean father figure dilemma.

The performers clearly benefited from his input; especially Cordero, in a role not too far removed from his Tony Award-nominated turn in the Woody Allen musical Bullets Over Broadway.  Orchestrations: Doug Besterman Set designer: Beowulf Boritt There’s also a very confusing moment involving a guy running with a Molotov cocktail, but never mind. 6:00 PM PST 12/1/2016 Broadway Review: ‘A Bronx Tale,’ The Musical By Marilyn Stasio. Murders are forgotten about and accusations pivot for no apparent reason. Playwright and actor Chazz Palminteri gives us the coming of age tale of an Italian-American boy named Calogero (Hudson Loverro when a child, Bobby Conte Thornton when on the cusp of manhood).  First performed as a solo piece in Los Angeles and off-Broadway in 1989 by the then-unknown writer-performer, it was revived on Broadway in 2007. Making his Broadway debut, Thornton is appealing and strong-voiced as the older Calogero, although he’s nearly outshone by Hudson Loverro, who plays the character’s pint-sized, younger counterpart. Calogero narrates the 1960s-set story, beginning — appropriately enough — with a segment set on Belmont Avenue featuring male doo-wop singers harmonizing under a streetlight (scenic designer Beowulf Boritt evokes this locale, along with many others of the Bronx neighborhoods, with affectionate stylization). His biological dad, Lorenzo (Richard H. Blake) is a good-hearted, bus driving, family man, but the adult he truly admires is Sonny (Nick Cordero), an all-powerful mob kingpin.
