Before commencing to ask these questions Lieutenant Morant said, 'If you tell the truth your life will be spared, if you tell lies you will be shot.'                                              In response, the captain departed Fort Edward on 2 August 1901 with the intention of ambushing the Viljoen Commando. According to South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt had received "warnings and expressions of caution" regarding "the wisdom of attacking an enemy position at night" without normal reconnaissance of the place. Before they left, Sgt.                                                 :  "[89], A frantic Major Thomas desperately tried to appeal to Lord Kitchener, but was informed by Major General W.F. During that duration, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant. About a week later, reports began to circulate that Reverend Heese had been found shot along the Pietersburg road about 15 miles (24 km) from the fort on his way to Pietersburg to report the activities of Morant and his group to the British authorities.

[citation needed] The Field Marshal was absent on tour when the executions took place. Morant had one peculiarity, which perhaps arose from his literary propensities - he was always very untidy in his dress; and though he claimed to be the descendant of a leading English family he never affected the "swell" in his manner, and he never tried to dress himself up to act the part of the well-connected "adventurer". So Morant and Handcock made two very basic errors: Once you’ve accepted the surrender, you take them to the railway line and get them shipped off to Bermuda, or wherever.                                     Do you want the padre? He became Resident Magistrate in Pietersburg and, as such, became involved with some of the descendants of the Bushveldt Carbineers victims. Other killings followed; on 23 August, Morant led a small patrol to intercept a group of eight prisoners from Viljoen's commando who were being brought in under guard; Morant ordered them to be taken to the side of the road and summarily shot.                                          Two main hearings were conducted at Pietersburg in relatively relaxed conditions; one concerned the shooting of Visser, the other the "Eight Boers" case.

"Horses with fever", you said. The bodies of all eight victims were then buried in a mass grave. The book was reprinted during 1982 following the success of the 1980 movie Breaker Morant.                                                 :                                           Some of this mail apparently never even left Pretoria, whilst certain letters did arrive at their destinations. 'You are the man who has worked up all the evidence and you ought to be ashamed of yourself for the betrayal of your brother officers.' Although acquitted of killing Reverend Heese, Morant and his co-accused were quickly sentenced to death on the other two charges. Australian Private Harry "Breaker" Morant, ca. There he changed his name to Harry Harbord Morant and reinvented his past. With a good commander over him he might have made a fine soldier. He will confirm it.

House of Representatives: Constituency Statement: Alex Hawke: Speech: Lieutenants Morant, Handcock and Witton (Monday, 27 February 2012).
