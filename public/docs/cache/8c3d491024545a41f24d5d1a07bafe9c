Look, educators use film clips all the time to illustrate a point. is one of the leading authorities on fraternity and sorority life.

Burning Sands has no control over the efficiency or delivery competency of the USPS service or their employees and if there are delays in delivery it is beyond our control. Burning Sands stars Trevor Jackson, Alfre Woodard, Trevante Rhodes, Steve Harris, and DeRon Horton. No one thinks about the harm that push-ups, jumping jacks and running around a track can do. It is those types of challenges that embraces the #BLM mantra and is necessary for the type of changes that are needed. Is it another way to focus on the negative aspects of BGLOs? So, it is very possible that there were even more incidents never reported about hazing at the hands of members our grandparents age. If you want to know more or withdraw your consent to all or some of the cookies, please refer to the privacy policy. Through the Harbor Institute, he has presented dynamic keynote speeches, interactive and engaging training sessions, and consulting for thousands of students and administrators at over 235 colleges and universities in 36 states. The truth is simple–telling it is difficult. What about the internal systems like Black fraternities and sororities, which can be also be destructive? The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2017, before being released on March 10, 2017, by Netflix What is apparent is that discussing hazing as it relates to historical, prominent and influential organizations that promote brotherhood/sisterhood, scholarship, service, and leadership is challenging. For example, Burning Sands could be used to start a discussion about how pledges going into financial debt is antithetical to the promotion of economic empowerment in the Black community. Lastly, BGLO members may have also needed a way to sift through the incredible growth of African-American students at colleges and universities across the country in the late 1970s after federal legislation made it easier for them to attend. The movement was created to address the injustices that Black people consistently suffer. “They paint this picture and call it brotherhood and sisterhood. While Burning Sands may be a new movie, hazing in Black fraternities is not. In the interactions between Prof. Hughes, we see this dance of truth vs. honesty. Burning Sands only explores the tip of the iceberg for Black fraternities and only one aspect of what may happen with specific chapters within these organizations. Here are 9 perspectives to consider when discussing hazing in BGLOs: Honesty is where we address only the question posed, usually filtering information based on the facts that paint us in the best light. Burning Sands stars Trevor Jackson, Alfre Woodard, Trevante Rhodes, Steve Harris, and DeRon Horton. Hazing behaviors are complex issues that cannot be resolved with one solution. As seen in the top photo above, the Burning Sands cast can be seen in Park City, Utah. Hazing is one of those behaviors. Advances in neuroscience teach us that trauma can literally rewire the brain making things seem “normal” that really aren’t, and causing us to repress memories until triggered. However, as previously mentioned, when the focus is on the most egregious acts, it doesn’t leave room to discuss the seemingly harmless behaviors that can lead to something far more dangerous. Syreeta N. Greene, Ed.D., MSW has been a higher education professional for over 15 years. Yeah, hazing should not exist. The abuse a pledgee has to endure is simple childish, evil, corrupt, ungodly and simply foolish. Plenty of loose ends with the Burning Sands ending could leave room for a Burning Sands sequel, or a Burning Sands TV or Netflix series. It’s unfair to exclusively blame today’s undergraduate BGLO members for a problem that has existed before they were born. In and of itself, each activity may be harmless. The new film Burning Sands on Netflix has ignited the Black Greek-Letter Organization (BGLO) community into a flurry of conversations about the film’s message, intent, and content. It is even possible that there are chapters that have actually done all of the things seen in the film. However, to have constructive conversations about hazing in Black fraternities and sororities one must have factual based evidence to substantiate, contextualize and provide accurate analysis. Burning Sands is a 2017 American drama film, directed by Gerard McMurray, from a screenplay by McMurray and Christine Berg.It stars Trevor Jackson, Alfre Woodard, Steve Harris, Tosin Cole, DeRon Horton and Trevante Rhodes.. His response, “I don’t see how we address the real issue by adopting half-baked urban myths. It is hard to get angry, disappointed and frustrated when law enforcement hides from accountability for its historic and systematic physical violence on Black men behind the “Blue Wall” when Black fraternities also hide behind a shield of “brotherhood.”. While the movie doesn’t wade into the membership experiences of women in BGLOs, Dr. Gina Lee-Olukoya, author of Sisterhood: Hazing and other membership experiences of women belonging to historically African American sororities, shares stories of some women reflecting that they have trouble with trust and meaningful relationships as a result of being on line. Others who have been through the process, like Facebook user Angela Crenshaw, decried the thought of fraternities and sororities. Being truthful requires us to respond to issues and questions based upon all the involved dynamics. According to researcher and professor, Dr. Aldo Cimino of the Center for Evolutionary Psychology in the Department of Anthropology at University of California, Santa Barbara, he suggests that “one potential function of hazing is to reduce newcomers’ ability to free ride around group entry.” His theory and initial experiments suggests that when new members of a group can receive ALL the same benefits of members who have been in the organization for many years, humans have a tendency to make these new members work harder to gain entry in the group to ensure they don’t become “free riders” in the group. Researchers from various fields ranging from public health to higher education agree that strategic educational preventive efforts are what reduce risky behaviors. In college, data shows that students participate in various risky behaviors. The film alludes to this issue without taking it on directly. The film was kind of like my hazing process.”. Gerard decided to put his Burning Sands hazing drama in “the Greek world,” which doesn’t mean Greece, but means in the world of fraternities and sororities. After 'Burning Sands,' Can We Actually Talk About Hazing, or Nah? Entertainment In her dissertation, Dr. Joyce Ester, President of Normandale Community College, spoke about the impact of being “in for a penny, in for a pound.” The truth is that some people seek to be hazed as a desire to belong to something meaningful. The truth is that low-key we know who some of the hazers are and don’t break the code of silence. As noted by its Netflix description, Burning Sands is a TV-MA movie that’s one hour and 42 minutes long, a “cerebral” and “gritty” movie that takes a hard look at the dark side of a fraternity. As seen in some of the below comments from social media, the #BurningSands hashtag found plenty of people either expressing their complete love or abject hate of Burning Sands on Netflix. 													TV & Film, Entertainment The truth is that our values clash with many of our practices. This support is evidenced in the forms of mentorship, familial support when a loved one passes away and even financial assistance for textbooks. The reality is there are chapters who may participate in an underground process who do not feel the need to beat, spit in someone’s face, or have sex with women to bring in new members. Remember, movies are for entertainment purposes. Some of the outright and knee-jerk criticism claiming that Burning Sands didn’t accurately depict the life of a fraternity member was quickly debunked by the fact that the director is himself a member of a fraternity, as stated in the interview on The Grio. These special connections, which are often not accounted for in the hazing discussion, may be reasons why the underground pledge process continues to exist. I really tried to limit my sleeping, just cut myself off everything else. Although the film has missing pieces, and should not be taken to represent all Black fraternities and sororities, there are parts of the film that are great teaching points possibly resulting in realistic, deep dive conversations. She’s a speaker and trainer who conducts student leadership training with culturally-based fraternal organizations on college campuses. To reduce negative incidents around sexual intercourse and drinking, we educate students on how to make better choices and how the wrong choices can have tremendous consequences with some success. The invisible side of hazing is the toll it takes on an individual’s psyche, and the long-term effect on their brain development. Therefore, late deliveries are not eligible for refunds or store credit. You know?”. But I tell you though experience IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!! Director Gerard McMurray told The Grio that his Burning Sands drama was inspired by the real-life death of Florida A&M University band member, Robert Champion. If they got through it, I can too.” The truth is that if I admit to myself that I allowed myself to be subjected to some intolerable mess, it has to mean something. Netflix's Burning Sands director and cast talk about what happened at the end of the movie, and what it's all about. Let’s start having some truthful dialogue about the topic. 													News Policy doesn’t disarm the belief that a process makes you a better soror/frat, or person.  So, there is much pressure to maintain what is considered tradition. It is not just about the current member’s ego issues, or pledge’s insecurity issues. It is ok to be passionate about an issue or topic. By the look on Zurich’s face, we can tell what he’s thinking. As a risk management consultant, speaker and trainer, Suzette seeks to help individuals and organizations realize their potential. Ignoring hazing, because the rules say it is illegal, is like ignoring texting and driving because the law states it is prohibited. Nearly two months later, after plenty of folks have gotten a chance to watch the premiere of Burning Sands on Netflix, loads of people are turning to social media to express their opinions about the movie. There is some information about the possibility of members utilizing the tactics learned from civil rights sit-in trainings to prepare pledges for the next phase of the movement. It is possible that all of the incidents have occurred with some chapters at some point in time.
