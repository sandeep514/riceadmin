It sounds like they were just re-telling the story of the derelict/pilot/xeno we got in Alien, but in an even less clear way. Really? Too many film sites cater to the same kind of audience, with one overwhelming voice in the writing, but what we treasure at Alternate Ending is diversity: diversity of opinion, diversity in belief about what film should do and how it should do it. Especially because the eighties stuff consistently looks better. It is retroactively setting up the "original" The Thing (1982) for which it is a prequel. I remember near the end of the movie, the main character is walking around in the alien ship. The survival of Kate in the new prequel is keeping the franchise open for a sequel to the original Carpenter film (Assuming she survives and isn't infected). That's really frustrating and annonying. How do I determine whether a switch can handle the power/current in a circuit? That's because Spontaneous is honest. SCARE ME that released October 1st on Shudder! Who’s going to tell Pence that flies have a bowel movement every 5 seconds. How is "officially" used in a non-literal way? Of note is that their appearance and that of the helicopter are mostly identical. After a few shots, he can't kill it; and during the last shot, the camera shows the gun and the screen goes black. Then she finds this part of the ship that is the most strangest thing you've ever seen. The Thing (2011) had an alternate ending & backstory where we meet the alien pilot of the crashed ship This is a place for people who can't get to the theater until the third week a film is out; a place for people who just want to find something great to stream online after the kids have gone to sleep, a place for people whose favorite pastime is to grab a bunch of classic films on DVD from the library and watch them all weekend. </p> <p>It is weird, fantastical, and out-of-the-box, but it is also true.”. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast, News & Discussion about Major Motion Pictures, Press J to jump to the feed. Why does use-package considers "emacs" as a package? Like cliche at every possible turn. The ending is so eager to set up the opening of Carpenter's film that it fails to do the more important task of ending this movie; people with no knowledge of the original thus get a anticlimactic sequel hook, while fans of the original are hardly going to give much credit to a crypto-remake that virtually identical territory in a considerably less imaginative way. </p> <p>Due to a studio interference, it was decided late in production to actually replace most of the practical work with digitally rendered effects, as the film “felt too 80s.”. </p> <p>The amount of detail they paid attention to in the prequel is pretty awesome! I'm guessing it was probably supposed to be a reactor core or some really alien computer interface or something. What happened at the end of The Thing (1982)? The ending of the film sees Lars and Matias chase after the dog-Thing in the helicopter and shooting at it with a rifle, leading directly into the opening of the 1982 film.

Does it affect print quality if a font in a .psd file is "missing" when received from a designer but you are NOT editing the text layer? It's the same thing as people complaining about CGI today. What happened at the end of The Thing 2011 version? The creature however survives, erupts from the craft and escapes — only to stop a few hundreds of meters away and freeze. This week you might have been hearing the buzz about the new horror/comedy (hormedy?) I didn't hate the 2011 remake, but the climax felt tame.

Cast : Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Joel Edgerton, Ulrich Thomsen, Genre : Horror, Science Fiction, Mystery, Thriller, “Spontaneous is a lot. At that point, just re-watch the original. Rob, the film-school dropout, has seen an absurd amount of movies, and if we’re being honest, rounds out our Fight Club fan-base. I never imagined that anyone would have seen the mediocre prequel but not the ridiculously amazing original movie, which is an absolute classic, and perhaps the greatest exemplar of its genre. But if we can pull this off, this movie will work perfectly [as] the first half of a double feature. If you actually sit down and watch the two movies back to back, you will see that this is pretty much the way it works out. Our goal is to save you time and money by sharing our thoughts and recommendations on which movies to race to theaters for, which to watch at home and those to actively avoid. But unfortunately those effects were also too heavy for their time, making the critics and audience reject it and thus missing the quality and much more subtle horror of the actual story. Here's what really, really frustrated me about the new, Alternate Ending was formed when three friends realized they all shared a passion for movies. And you can plug in Carpenter's film and they will both feel and look as they have been made around the same time. They come up with a really great idea... and then they don't use it in the movie? </p> <p>If the new Star Wars taught us nothing else, it's that audiences really appreciate a concerted effort made to make sequels/prequels feel cut from the same cloth as the original. What the difference between Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf and Array.isPrototypeOf? I remember feeling exactly how she reacted to seeing it, like, 'what....the....fucking...hell....is...that?' </p> <p>And too much CG. So The Thing (user reviews) opened over the weekend to somewhat disappointing box office and mixed-to-negative reviews. @NapoleonWilson - Now it includes a quote from the screenwriter. </p> <p>Yesterday, I watched the original. The starting scene of the 1982 movie is two Norwegians in a helicopter chasing and shooting at a sled dog that finds its way to an American camp. The dog survives and arrives at an American station, this is what starts the Carpenter version from 1982. Press question mark to learn the rest of the keyboard shortcuts. Cool! This isn't a site for people who just want to talk about the latest hot new movies in theaters right this minute. Cool! We’re two dudes, and a lady, of which our tastes are quite varied. It only takes a minute to sign up. Wish they had gone with that to be honest. Can the Ollamh Harp and Anstruth Harp be carried as easily as lute. Just like there were good practical effects and bad practical effects in the 80s. They chase the dog on a helicopter and Lars tries to shoot the dog from some distance. I think it's less "cut from the same cloth" and more "well-done practical effects look far more real than heavy CGI". It was only much later that this movie got the appreciation it deserves.

The prequel did almost everything wrong, but this is one of the few exceptions to that rule. Well, your emotions are interesting and I definitely share them (though, the prequel wasn't mediocre in my mind, but sure, there isn't anything that could not be inferior to the '82 movie), but I fail to see in which way this adds so much more to the already 3 years old accepted answer, or you might want to flesh it out a little more to point out in which way it does. Responding to the Lavender Letter and commitments moving forward. </p> <p>Date time in two rows in Italian format and time zone. I understand that Kate at the end is the only one left and pretty much her fate is up to the viewer. So that the last shot of this film will be two Norwegians and a chopper chasing after a dog. What happens there? Can I publish a GPL source I'm being paid for to develop? How angles transform under Lorentz transforms - a thought experiment. But because it was too 80's is deplorable. If and when I find more information, I will add it. A big pulsating column of what appears to be pixels or pixely blocks, in a radiantly blue color. At the end of The Thing (2011), Lars and his friend pursue a possibly infected dog which runs away from the facility. That blue blocks computer-reactor-decoration thing is a quick CG job done to obscure the finished alien pilot puppet.
