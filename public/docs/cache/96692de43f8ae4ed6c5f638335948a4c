Loves all things pop-culture especially if it has a bit of a counter-culture twist.  I heard a lot of good things about this early film by Francis Ford Coppola (Dracula, Apocalypse Now, The Godfather series) before watching it and, maybe because of that, I was a little disappointed. Like [Coppola's] later Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), it's an intriguing example of style over substance. It is now in public domain and easily found online.

THE REVIE… twitter.com/i/web/status/1…, Can you use your 9 lives to save Felingard? An upstart's precocious proposal on artistry, independence, and the business of family, or vice-versa, So-so Irish axe murderer romp, via a young Francis Ford Coppola. The movie has two different runtimes because Corman wanted the feature longer and an additional scene with a doctor testing the audience for the mental ability to handle the film’s violence was part of the trailer and sometimes added as added as a prologue (the D-13 test)…this scene isn’t always available on all versions.  There is no linking or other HTML allowed. [Full Review in Spanish].  While it starts out appearing to be about Luana Anders’ character, she is quickly dispatched by the axe murderer, and it then becomes a mystery of who the axe murderer is, how Kathleen died, and solving the crime. Using the childhood death of one of her children named Kathleen, Louise has a plan…but plans have a way of changing when a serial killer is revealed to be stalking the family’s castle.

The movie was critically panned when it was originally released as part of a double bill with Corman’s X, The Man with X-Ray Eyes. The film starts as a thriller and goes on like this for the first half. This was for the good points. The location (an Irish castle) is used imaginatively, the Gothic atmosphere is suitably potent, and there's a wonderfully sharp cameo from Patrick Magee as the family doctor. With a whole bunch of additions, tweaks, and things like the prologue, Dementia 13 comes off as a mess. Despite the rough edges, you feel you're in the hands of someone who enjoys telling a story, and knows how to do it - even when the story's a disposable one such as this. Dementia 13 also looks pretty good. On the less bright side, I also found that the lengthy dialogues, which often are the glory of 60’s horror films (Psycho, The Innocents), are here relatively basic and tend to sometimes break the flow of the movie! Rate This Movie : SYNOPSIS: “John Haloran has a fatal heart attack, but his wife Louise won’t get any of the inheritance when Lady Haloran dies if John is dead.
