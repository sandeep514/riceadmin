History, spirituality, philosophy, (geo)politics, & music all written in a white knuckle-like thriller style. Synopsis. <br> <br>I am laughing myself silly, wondering if anything like the events in this book could possibly occur today? This is a low 3. <br> <br>Add in Richard Nixon, who in an effort to distract the public from Vietnam and Watergate called Leary “The most dangerous man in America,” and you’ve got a stranger than fiction tale from the early years of the 1970s. A romp through Nixonian might and Leary escapism. The Most Dangerous Man In America follows Leary's daring prison escape and run from the law in 1970. A fascinating look at a brief period in the life of LSD prophet Timothy Leary, when he escaped from a California prison, went to Algeria (as an unwelcome guest of the Eldridge Cleaver and the Black Panthers), then Switzerland, then Afghanistan, before finally being extradited. A fast-paced examination of the years that Dr. Timothy Leary spent on the lam. It looks like we don't have a Synopsis for this title yet.

What emerges is a man of high ideals and exceptional determination who still has a keen sense of guilt for his former role in promoting war.
