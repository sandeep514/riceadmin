Produced by Anthrax with Carl Canedy, the 44-minute Spreading the Disease marked the first Anthrax album to feature singer Belladonna and bassist Frank Bello (joining drummer Benante and guitarists Dan Spitz & Scott Ian), and set into motion the core elements that would become the essence of Anthrax.

Armed And Dangerous * Anthrax blast back with a brutal sophomore album, Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2013. A special two-disc edition of the album was released in 2015, celebrating its 30th anniversary. After briefly considering making Ian the singer, the group auditioned Belladonna, whose higher-register voice set the group apart from the barks and snarls of the other bands in what would become thrash’s “Big Four,” Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer. Now, to celebrate the record’s anniversary, the group is putting out a deluxe edition of Spreading the Disease, set for release on November 20th. The end result plays like a non-stop, forty-four-minute long ball of white hot rage and hyper-kinesis. I think every song on ‘STD’ still stands up today.”.

Spreading the Disease represented a turning point in rock. Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2018. The album is actually better than I remember with not just the classic tunes sounding good. And Anthrax, along with Metallica, Slayer and Megadeth – was right at its nucleus. I'd place them in a more speed/classic heavy metal niche. The album was compelling and utterly fresh to the 1985 music fan with its speedy rhythms, savage riffs, blistering solos, punishing drum work and a killer melodic performance by Belladonna. Aftershock ** Unlike the thrash bands sprouting up on the west coast that focused on speed, Anthrax’s focus was on catchiness, hooks, and a hot and sweaty, New York mosh sensibility. “Madhouse” ** 17. “Gung-Ho” * 8. I guess it’s a manufacturing issue. We were just trying to do the best that we possibly could, trying to make a move here, a move there. “Gung-Ho” ** 11.

Three decades after its debut, comes this special 30th anniversary edition of Anthrax's classic Spreading The Disease, the band's second studio album and the one … Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2020. Spreading the Disease contains several Anthrax standouts:  “A.I.R.,” with its great riffs and abundance of melody, “Madhouse,” a testament to the band’s top-notch song-writing skills that showcased their grasp of melody, and “Armed and Dangerous,” a soulful ballad with its singalong chorus and spine-tingling performance by Belladonna.

Anthrax Celebrate 30th Anniversary of 'Spreading the Disease' Consequently, in addition to the original album’s nine tracks, the two-disc anniversary edition features previously umreleased bonus material including Joey Belladonna’s 1984 demo recording of the song “Medusa,” nine “rhythm tracks” from Anthrax recordings also done in 1984 – no vocals, no overdubs or “sweetening,” just drums, some guitar, a bit of bass, showing the songs in their naked, most basic form, and eight live songs from Anthrax’s 1987, first-ever concert in Japan, held at Tokyo’s Sun Plaza. I never really thought Anthrax fitted the thrash tag as (the first album aside) their music was never really manic enough. There's a problem loading this menu right now. “Armed and Dangerous” 8. And it wasn’t just the music that was morphing, it was a whole new culture that was being birthed. 				Anthrax,				Scott Ian. Metal Thrashing Mad ** “Aftershock” is probably the album’s punkiest song with its blistering guitar solo, and the closer, “Gung Ho,” with its out-and-out speed-kills blitzkrieg, is a superb piece of thrash metal.
