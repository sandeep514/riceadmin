Many of these books are all time classics appealing to all ages. He felt her bow her head in acknowledgment that sheunderstood. He, too, wasplainly expecting some one; could it be herself? After 21 years, Henchard's vow of abstinence expires, and he starts drinking again. heexclaimed; adding more softly, "but think of me sometimes inyour future life--you'll do that, Izzy?--think of me whenyou are living as the wife of the richest, the foremost manin the town, and don't let my sins, WHEN YOU KNOW THEMALL, cause 'ee to quite forget that though I loved 'ee lateI loved 'ee well.". But we must guard againsta too liberal use of the conventional declaration that agreat sensation was caused by the prospective event, thatall the gossips' tongues were set wagging thereby, and so-on, even though such a declaration might lend some eclat tothe career of our poor only heroine.

Farfrae buys Henchard's old business and tries to help Henchard by employing him as a journeyman. She wandered about this place, uncomfortably conscious ofthe impending interview, till she was quite weary ofsearching; she ventured to inquire of a boy in what quarterMr. theyoung man still replied, with some distress in his accents. "She'll wishher cake dough afore she's done of him. “We must get a place "But it will belong before I see one that would suit me so well! She won'tobject.

Drunk on rum-laced furmity he auctions her off, along with their baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane, to Richard Newson, a passing sailor, for five guineas. They thought him very simple not to know their grimbroad way of talking about themselves here. But judgment and knowledge are what keepit established. ", We see that Henchard is a lonely man and has been looking for another employee who would be of value to him in his business and as a friend. Can't ye stayjust the same? And, Mr. Farfrae, as you provide somuch, and houseroom, and all that, I'll do my part in thedrinkables, and see to the rum and schiedam--maybe a dozenjars will be sufficient?--as many of the folk will beladies, and perhaps they won't drink hard enough to make ahigh average in the reckoning? ... What does Henchard persuade the town’s musicians to play at the Three Mariners Inn? ", "Now, that's very much as I thought," said Newson, lookinginto the face of each by turns.

'Twas as much my fault ashis, poor fellow! "When a man is said to be worth so much a minute,he's a man to be considered! "I am--a good deal interested in your news," he said. The thing is so natural and easy that it ishalf done in thinking o't. Her mother,instead of taking the note with the curiosity of a poorwoman expecting assistance, was much moved at sight of it.She did not read it at once, asking Elizabeth to describeher reception, and the very words Mr. Henchard used.Elizabeth's back was turned when her mother opened theletter.

I have to be away for aday or two on business, unfortunately; but during that timeyou can get lodgings--the only ones in the town fit for youare those over the china-shop in High Street--and you canalso look for a cottage. The rich rouge-et-noir of his countenance underwent aslight change.

Henchard paused in reverie. You are justthe reverse--I can see that. HitherwardHenchard often resorted, glass in hand, and scanned thehedgeless Via--for it was the original track laid out bythe legions of the Empire--to a distance of two or threemiles, his object being to read the progress of affairsbetween Farfrae and his charmer.
