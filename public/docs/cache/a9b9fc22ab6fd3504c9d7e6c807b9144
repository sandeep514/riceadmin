It shows us a few ‘how-to-do’ magic tricks and just when we think we can unravel all the mysteries behind all their magic, it throws us a curve ball which leaves us dumbfounded(in a positive sense). </p> <p>Nothing there lived up to my expectations. The twists and turns of it appealed to me more. </p> <p>Yes, the merits of a film can very well be argued, but that argument just made me shake my head. They are both excellent films, with sumptuous, breath-taking cinematography, twisting plots and top acting throughout. </p> <p>He also insists that the movie allows the viewer to fill in the blanks. </p> <p>. But then….I used to be, too. http://www.femail.com.au/image.php?imagename=hellboy2int.jpg&imagetype=b. They are usually outstanding. That’s the reason I want to see The Avengers. Mike and I are just about watching one a night and from what I’m reading there have only been six episodes, with more in the works, but not ready yet. There are certainly more than a handful of films that have left me dumbfounded and feeling as if I’d wasted good time and money. I can’t believe how fast he turns out new projects. I’m going to have to make a list of all these movies and mini-series you’ve mentioned. I hope you and Frank are doing better. </p> <p>And I found the scene changes rapid and abrupt. Anonymous. It’s been a fun evening. How did Norton summon images and have them wander around? </p> <p>Using confusion to mask a deeply inter-connected and clever plot would be art, but simply being confusing is showing a lack of grasp of one’s art. Don’t care. Especially peculiar is that you would complain about this in a movie about magic and deception. I’ve never seen a Hulk movie, or any of the Hellboy films. But going on a little further, watching The Prestige on DVD recently with my husband gave me a broader view of the film and caught some of the things I’d missed. The Illusionist, on the other hand, focuses on the power of seduction. . Really can't answer your question. He and his wife have EIGHT kids. The Illusionist acquiesces this responsibility in a cloud of smoke.-, To wrap this up — here we are at odds again. I'm sure those who have seen it know what I'm talking about. (Chuckle). Thanks for the opportunity to talk this out a little. Linda. </p> <p>You know the guy. Needless to say it was an eye-opener for me. </p> <p>Edward Norton’s trademark intensity works to his advantage in his portrayal of the mysterous Eisenheim, a master illusionist who has risen to become the greatest magician in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. </p> <p>Good grief. I liked Road to Perdition a lot. When Watching the Illusionist, I felt as though I was reading a fable, while, as I was watching the Prestige I felt I was watching an adaptation from a Steven King book. </p> <p>I have been a fan of Edward Norton since “The Illusionist”. The Illusionist is not without its redeeming qualities. </p> <p>Not at all. And I have watched the trailer for the new Star Trek many times. </p> <p>The other was The Prestige. It had another of my favorites in it, Gerard Butler. He takes the opportunity to humiliate Leopold, a move which at first seems dangerously foolhardy, but turns out to be just one step in a scheme to frame Leopold for murder and allow the two lovers to escape together. Next, more or less in order, were Hawking (he played Stephen Hawking), Starter for 10 (starred James McAvoy), Amazing Grace (he played William Pitt), Atonement (based on the book by Ian McEwan, which is fantastic), The Other Boleyn Girl (about Anne Boleyn), The Last Enemy (a terrific British mini-series that I have on DVD), Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, War Horse, Parade’s End (another great British mini-series), and finally Sherlock. It’s as if they had a hat they threw the scenes in and picked them out at random instead of following some kind of logical sequence. I’m not a superhero fan. . My husband is 6′ 3″ and USED to be lean. Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967), La La Land (2016) vs. New York, New York (1977), MARVEL v DC: The Ultimate Movie Smackdown, SMASHUP: GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VS. I’ve seen War Horse, but didn’t equate that character with Sherlock — I mean Benedict. But, as I told another commentor, the merits of a film are always arguable, and I could have been having a bad brain day that day. </p> <p>I don’t go at all for the overly muscled type. But he is a fantastic actor. I was emotional and mesmerized. Much better than I thought it'd be. It was (this may sound funny) cartoonish. Joined Oct 21, 2007 Messages 1,945 Location Tartarus. I have both of these movies on DVD and love them equally, largely because they both have such terrific casts. Which should I watch tonight? Tremendous performance from the always delightful Paul Giamatti, but, in the end, the focus on a secondary character is unbecoming  in comparison to The Prestige, which closely holds its main characters, if, as you say, “at arms length,” then at least within grasp. However, rather like the illusions our magical protagonists perform, once you know the tricks they stop impressing so allow me to veil the plot details in smoke and mirrors. </p> <p>And yes, I’ve seen Reign of Fire. He’s played sword-swinging knights and may have given hell on the battlefield, but I’ve never considered him as a “Hellboy”. Over the hundred-plus years of cinematic history, there has been enough movie magic to create a worldwide love affair with film. But truly, the worst of it, is I was never surprised by The Illusionist. Have you seen Gerald Butler and Hilary Swank in P. S. I Love You? Loved that movie, though it didn’t get any good reviews. </p> <p>I haven’t even seen any of the Iron Man movies, but I plan to someday because I like Robert Downey, Jr..  And I have The Avengers in my Netflix queue. The Prestige (Read 3691 times) Queen Mum Inks.LWC Inks.LWC Atlas Superstar Posts: 35,103. Its story telling, its acting. VS I&#39;ve watched both of these movies and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who has noticed the similari It happens. Enjoyed. When some very dangerous men appear at the hotel near Tesla’s laboratory, a character asks if they work for the government. Paul Daniels and the fat bloke that used to be married to Victoria Wood. I loved how it pulled everything together in the end (i felt like i got like slapped in the face i was like wow) also i loved the kiss scene so good! </p> <p>He probably doesn’t have time to make movies anymore. The Prestige is not only better than The Illusionist, in my opinion, The Prestige is better than most films ever produced…it is my favorite work from Nolan, and that’s saying something considering his pedigree. Political Matrix E: 4.77, S: -2.09: The Illusionist vs. Even the simple tricks of the young Illusionist levitating the playing card is something that doesn’t seem possible without “movie magic”. Much of the time they talk that way because they lack any other vocabulary, but I don’t like it in a story where it doesn’t fit and is used only for effect. </p> <p>Whatever you do, don’t watch American Psycho, Shutter Island, Fight Club, Oldboy, Blade Runner, and many many many others. Wow. </p> <p>The prestige had a better cast, but i think the illusionist made you think more. And I never could see the purpose of twisting all these characters into such miserable, though brilliant, people. What a dunce I am!!! The brutality to children was the main reason it was so hard to watch “Flowers of War”. You say it probes the secrets if life and death, date and chance, but it does neither. The Prestige is an excellent film that makes us wonder about science fiction and the humanity in us, The Illusionist is a tourism film masked with cliches and been there done that plot. I like medieval period dramas and he’s played in several of those. But darned if I don’t still like The Illusionist better. All in all, if no one has seen this movie, it's absolutely worth the watch. As for a type, I like tall mean (at least 6 ft.) and lean. It seems, at core, an issue of the suspension of disbelief. Of course, a great cast and crew helps, and special mention must go to cinematographer Dick Pope who was nominated for an Academy Award, deservedly so, and to the production design by Ondrej Nekvasil who brings to life the Vienna of Sigmund Freud. It’s one of my absolute favorite TV shows, but it would not be your cup of tea. But I really liked Mark Ruffalo as “The Hulk”. </p> <p>Hee ! Chris Nolan’s direction has the steady, assured markings of a director who knows when the story and acting is more than strong enough to carry a scene without superfluous flourishes, which has the welcome side effect of giving Tesla’s gadgetry a grandiose visual motif that wouldn’t otherwise have been quite so impressive. I think itâs his finest performance.”. I, too, have watched it several times. </p> <p>See . :>). His are a little too hard core SF for my taste but we love watching the movie versions together. Special mention should also go to cinematographer Wally Pfister who keeps the hocus-pocus in focus and to production designer Nathan Crowley who especially stands out among all who helped give The Prestige outstanding production values. Filming is currently well underway for season 3 and season 4 has already been green lighted. is still one of my all time favorite shots. I agree with everything except I did not much enjoy The Illusionist. However, I must confess I’ve always found Richard Dreyfus kind of cute. It’s not bad to like a film that makes you feel good, but to go after another cause it doesn’t says a lot about what makes you tick. And just as you would expect from a world-class magician, The Prestige is clever, tricky and deceitful. Still can’t take the language, though. Perhaps a tertiary need in other genres, the magician film genre seems to beg us to question it. Your comment — Mr. Norton, did his best, but never seemed to rise above the material and give it life.–. This film is not about them. Sorry not to reply sooner. </p> <p>Great review. This film’s about Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). The Prestige. Totally off topic, but I received an email notice that you had commented here and just want to say I’m glad to see you. The illusionist bothers me. He is such a versatile actor. First, the good – the film looks appealing, the costumes in particular being of high quality, and the exteriors of Tabor and Prague, standing in for Vienna, give the setting an authentic period feel. </p> <p>I can’t even imagine having 13 children, but it’s was common years ago, especially if you farmed and needed the children to help. In Primal Fear, it represented the charater’s rage with everything in his life. Both ‘Illusionist’ and ‘Prestige’ have a twist ending each. I only scanned this, but I saw them both when they came out and also several times each after that. </p> <p>The Prestige: One is Magic, the Other Tedious, http://www.moviesmackdown.com/2009/01/prestige-vs-illusionist.html. Now that our rivals are in their respective corners, let’s get out the wands and let the magic begin. Ms. Johansson may not be the best actress in the world, but who cares? </p> <p>I watched Always last night. Wrong order. Both good, but the prestige is something else, go watch it now! So much I had missed watching it at the theater!!! I have to ask if the language is necessary to the story for character, and even then not dominating the dialogue. ***. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:31:"the illusionist vs the prestige";s:5:"links";s:8082:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/static-electricity-diagram-86e6ec'>Static Electricity Diagram</a>,
