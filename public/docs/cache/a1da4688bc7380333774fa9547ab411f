This was rejected when his parents refused to allow him to give up college to play professional soccer. | His most famous role was that of helpful neighbor Wilson W. Wilson, Jr. in the popular sitcom "Home Improvement" (1991-1999). Another running gag is Tim accidentally causing damage or destruction to anything he touches – such as destroying the world's smallest car or running over golf carts with a Marine Corps tank. Beginning at the end of the fifth season, Al invented a second source of income for himself by inventing a board game based on Tool Time, which features Tim, Al and Heidi as playable characters. During high school, he wrote a school article that turned many adults against Tim for Binford's pollution record, threatening his father's reputation, and he bitterly disapproved of Brad's jockish article earning the paper's front page, which was usually occupied by Randy's articles. He often voices apelike grunts in a range of tones and inflections to convey emotions for comic effect, such as confusion, irritation, or pride. All our neighbor does is yell at us when we forget to move the trashcan back from the curb. Benny is a bit of a slacker and notoriously known as a freeloader – his trademark being drinking coffee and eating donuts. He wrote for the school newspaper, where he concentrated on social and political issues, including criticizing Binford for its pollution record, which led to a fierce disagreement with Tim and Tim's boss. He is not-so-happily married to his wife Delores (Shirley Prestia), and the couple incessantly bad-mouth one another behind their respective backs, as well as occasionally to each other's face. Randy often relates more with his mother, with whom he shares his intelligence and enjoyment of acting (although Tim embarrassed Randy during one acting scene thanks to a malfunctioning stage prop). Mark's relationship with Brad and Randy was often adversarial, especially in early seasons as he was often the butt of their jokes, pranks and teasing. His Gothic appearance was gone by the end of the series. His usual greetings are "Well, hi-dee-ho ..." or "Hi ho, there neighbor" or "good neighbor" when greeting Tim, "neighborette" when greeting Jill, and "Taylor lad(s)" when greeting the Taylor boys. Tim jokes about Al's mom "looking for a smorgasbord".  This article contains character information for the American television sitcom Home Improvement.

Tim also often pokes fun at Al's mother, Alma Borland, who is never seen (except her hand and forearm, in season 8), but is apparently severely overweight. In a recurring gag, the lower half of Wilson's face was usually hidden by a tall fence. In one episode where Tool Time is celebrating their fifth anniversary show, Al is shown in the first ever episode of Tool Time clean shaven, while Tim has a beard.[4].

Another gag is that Tool Time fans believe his many accidents are staged, to show people what not to do. He does not share many interests with his brothers or father, and in the early seasons was often the victim due to his naïveté of some practical joke that Brad and Randy had thought up on the spot for him.

[5] Initially, the character was seen only in and around the Tool Time set.

As a child, his parents did not allow him to speak to his neighbors, so he really likes talking to Tim and Jill. While most of his appearances were to help the Taylors, on seldom occasion someone who was in the extended family, or a nonmember, such as Al, would seek out Wilson's advice. Earl Hindman was behind the eyes of the man we grew to know and love. In 1942, Hindman was born in Bisbee, Arizona, which at the time was a mining city. Taylor's "arch enemy", so to speak, is the real-life home improvement specialist, Bob Vila. In fact, when Tim would come to him for advice, you never knew what Wilson would be doing behind that dang fence. Jill graduated from Adams High School (taken from an actual high school in Rochester Hills, Michigan) in 1973.

His father has a tendency to dislike and mock anything he has no interest in, such as ballet and opera, and Randy inherited this attitude, which ironically puts him at odds with Tim, since Randy has no interest in cars and tools. Unlike Tim and Brad, Randy is not good with his hands and does not enjoy working on crafts or the Hot Rod. He generally knows what he is doing more than Tim, and he seems to have a better knowledge of tools and home improvement than Tim.

She died from a heart attack near the end of the series after Al asked her permission to marry Trudy. Harry has four sons, including Dennis (David DeLuise), with whom he has a somewhat rocky relationship, but they reconcilled.
