Just like a well known groundhog has to deal with his shadow every spring, LSU might still be dealing with Saban’s for quite a few more November’s. © LSU Athletics, Louisiana State University 2020. If you want to make Auburn’s up for debate go ahead. In the 2019 season, LSU snapped Alabama’s 31 consecutive home game winning streak, alone with snapping Clemson’s 29 consecutive game winning streak. Let me correct my self, 2016 was Ed O’s intern year. But life is cyclical. What? Bama isn’t the only team to lose a bowl after being named NC. </p> <p>Originality is not exactly this site’s strong suit. </p> <p>Wait is this true??? And Bama won it again in 1965… Change the rules and they still won it…. That still leaves 7 they do recognize if 11-4 still equals 7. </p> <p>No team in program history accomplished what the 2019 Tigers did. Well, at least it’s not as bad as getting your new coach a future national championship plaque: Texas A&M awards themselves a hypothetical future National Championship – upon completion it will be displayed in Atlantis in a flying car pic.twitter.com/LbYrNVCVqz, — RedditCFB (@RedditCFB) February 28, 2018. No LSU fan looks at it that way. I mean if he wasn’t struggling his ass off against them, well than the chances are he wouldn’t have been begging Chip Kelly for help to learn how to defend against them better than what he was doing against them, right ?? LSU has the 3rd longest active consecutive season bowl game appearances streak in the country. The Vols celebrated the Litkenhous national championship. I’d argue 2012 Texas A&M has a far better claim for a national title than 1941 Alabama. Really? With the 2019 College Football Playoff national championship on Jan. 13, 2020, LSU has won a total of 48 team National Championships, including 43 NCAA-sponsored national titles. Heck, while I’m at it as the only winner of the CFP I hereby strip TrunksnorterU of their 2017 trophy due to failing to win their conference, lol. </p> <p>Love it! Whether it’s a blip or not, no one can’t point to Saban as being the last time LSU was great. So, yea this season, especially in regards to the 2011 NCG, brought some healing. Well, how about this:  Three SEC teams have been to the Rose Bowl, all more than once. BTW thanks for beating ND last year, and good luck in Columbia in November this year. They try to slip it under the radar in a self-complimentary way and usually end up getting ripped for it. Burrow was there the year before and LSU didnt win it all. t5. The single best defensive performance that Nick Saban has ever had against an elite up tempo spread offense was when he ran crying to the NCAA trying to get them to outlaw them by claiming that they were dangerous to the players. Easy, little fella – Geaux Long’s just pointing out the obvious. After that year the NC was awarded after the bowl games. Yikes. And as for your “utterly destroying the Miami Dolphins” comment… Miami has appeared in 2 playoff games since 2002. t20. Truth is, Coach O is their DADDY for the moment, which makes their collective head explode. LOL. Thanks everyone, this really helps with my off season football withdrawl !!! Spoiler alert — A&M doesn’t have one of the SEC’s 3 most egregious claimed national titles. 2001, 2004 Connor O'Gara is the senior national columnist for Saturday Down South. That brings us to Jeff Sagarin, AKA the MIT graduate who took rankings to a different, more analytical level. The question now is how good was LSU without Joe Burrow? What was lsu record with Bo Pelini before. Notre Dame’s might be cut in half. One of Auburn fans’ biggest rip on Alabama is their unclaimed titles and to claim a title you didn’t play for will make you a hypocrite since yall like bashing Alabama for the exact same thing, regardless of your reason behind it. Ok BamaSlime sorry I forgot to ask you if I could post, is it ok if I stay on the board? Atcheson bumped Alabama’s national title total from 6 to 11. No, this year’s Tigers were better; better prepared, better disciplined, better physically, better in every way. That’s funny….looking “back” we won a Natty in 1998, georgia’s last one was 1980…..hmmmmmm. Someone should write an article about ripped off SEC teams with retro computer calculation on SOS etc. </p> <p>Insane dual-threat ability. Utah, Oklahoma twice, Ohio St., Ole Miss under Hugh Freeze, Texas A&M with Johnny Manziel, Clemson, Auburn under Gus Malzahn & now LSU. Followed by the 2019 regular season games against LSU & Auburn ?? </p> <p>For example, going undefeated like Alabama did in 1934 and not getting recognized as a national champ by the NCAA seems, well, justified. </p> <p>North Carolina 31 1933, 1989, 1990, 2002 These days, that’s how you’ll find out about claimed national titles. By the numbers compiled by the College Football Data Warehouse, LSU ranks as 1 of the top 10 greatest programs in the history of college football. Bama Slime – say it for me. They haven’t won a playoff game since 2000. Connecticut 16, * - The NCAA does not recognize champions from the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (including the Bowl Championship Series and College Football Playoff), and did not award team championships until 1939. Baseball (6)  10. While I’m at it, let’s eliminate cases where the recognized national champ had as many losses as the SEC team that tried to claim that title. Hold on, let me get my notes. Picture a 2020 universe in which that happens. 2011 LSU & Alabama BCS mythical FBS football championship game. But they are. For the next edition of Debates Down South, you guys should definitely discuss whether or not it makes any sense to have a Yankee from IU writing about SEC athletics. Well, I sort of answered that already. Here is another fun fact for ya – UGA has more egregiously claimed pre-season titles than the rest of the sec combined. I’ll confirm it for you. At least not that punishment. A fan sent a picture to Deadspin of some additions to A&M’s “Wall of Champions,” which was part of a renovation to Kyle Field. Having the AP or UPI results in a split title… Adding in some random polls not recognized by the NCAA doesn’t mean anything…. He beat up on the entire conference. 1. #1. Well if that’s the case it’s the same thing for Bama being awarded them Before the bowls by the AP or UPI… There was only certain recognized voters. Or dare say polls. So Auburn didn’t meet the criteria you’re trying to lay down.. “Adding in some random polls not recognized by the NCAA doesn’t mean anything…”. 60 U.S. colleges shut down their football programs before the 1942 season. It’s just another bowl game unless it involves the championship. </p> <p>Cam carried that team. You’re out of your mind if you think burrow carried that team.. Glenn Sattell is an award-winning freelance writer for Saturday Down South. There’s no good way to announce a title is suddenly claimed decades later, and it’s a punchline waiting to happen. That is what happens when Auburn blows all of its cash on one player. That gets rid of 1942 Georgia, 1950 Kentucky, 1950 Tennessee. All-time great. Arkansas 42 Claimed national championships are weird. No doubt. But I mean, there are several Bama titles up for debate. Give me a quick timeout. Doesn’t matter the talent around him, Burrow was the reason that team was so good just as Cam was for Auburn. </p> <p>Number of both claimed & unclaimed mythical FBS football national championships since the 2000 season up until right now. The Rebels essentially did what 2011 Alabama did. I’m sorry, but outside of Auburn fans you wont find many people saying Cam had the better season than Burrow did. 73 you lost to ND for the title. Egregious? The healing of a fan base won’t be overlooked when reflecting on the jubilation that this season brought. </p> <p>The much better debate is with Tebow in 2007. Life continued after he left. The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and America immediately entered World War II. Not since 1958 had LSU recorded an undefeated season (11-0), led by Billy Cannon who was also the school’s only Heisman Trophy winner until Joe Burrow earned the award for his legendary season, breaking nearly every passing record in the books. Fisher is starting with a program that hadn’t been ranked in a few years. He's a member of the Football Writers Association of America. The point is, it doesn’t take much for some teams to claim a national title. Jameis Winston the Assaulter is the only reason Jimbo got his deal. Every time the NCG is in New Orleans. Doug Dickey said of the 1967 in a 50th anniversary story that “when you beat Alabama, Auburn, LSU and Ole Miss, you’ve done pretty well.” He’s not wrong. I read it in another site. When it comes out that a team claimed a national championship 50 years after the fact, we all collectively scratch our heads. So apparently CM is also free at acknowledging actual football games. LSU has been on probation more recently than Bama…. Bama is still out-recruiting LSU (not by a mile, but still at the top) and could easily come right back this year and beat everyone to win the SEC so that this past season just ends up looking like an anomaly in the continued domination. We didn’t deserve the punishment. Spot on. Georgia left its star running backs, Frank Sinkwich and Charley Trippi, in the game well into the fourth quarter. Remember when Alabama lost to Clemson in the College Football Playoff National Champion at the end of the 2016 season? Facts are a stubborn thing…. Which gives Burrow an advantage in the argument. 3. 10. Florida 18 Even the flawed collegiate model of football can do this. If 1941 was the only one Auburn fans complained about sure, that’s not the case though. Speaking of 30 years….oh wait Georgia’s NC was 40 years ago but who’s counting (except Georgia fans)? Remarkably, we had the same records (although reversed) as Ed O’s first two years in Baton Rouge. That’s a fairly odd statement considering Georgia has 3 conference titles in the last 37 seasons. And the games you listed are over a 10 year time frame… How many times did other SEC teams get beat over that same time frame? I mean if he wasn’t struggling his ass off against them, well than the chances are he wouldn’t have been begging Chip Kelly for help to learn how to defend against them better than what he was doing against them, right ??”. </p> <p>Oklahoma St. 52 Which gets me to my bias point. Do I regret it? 5. Here is a fact – nobody in the SEC is out of Bama’s/Saban’s shadow in football. It doesnt matter the talent around him, thats incredible. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:36:"lsu unclaimed national championships";s:5:"links";s:4918:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/battleship-2-2018-86e6ec'>Battleship 2 2018</a>,
