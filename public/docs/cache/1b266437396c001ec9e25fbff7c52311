Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. Writer-director Tom McCarthy (Win Win, The Visitor) has his weaknesses, but working with actors isn’t among them, and he hands Clarkson one of the juiciest roles of her career, first letting her embody a ray of sunshine in a mopey protagonist’s life without asking her to hit the joie de vivre throttle, then letting her do an entirely credible about-face that serves as the movie’s emotional fulcrum.

But it’s rare to see an actor this talented appear onscreen seemingly out of nowhere so late in life—she was 51 at the time, and had spent years honing her craft in the theater, unwilling to play stock Middle Eastern villains—so her presence has the unexpected force of a revelation.
