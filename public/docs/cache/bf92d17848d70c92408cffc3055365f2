Irish played in Reading, Berkshire but are moving back to the capital. Bees boss Thomas Frank will be hoping his side can go one better this season after narrowly missing out on promotion to the Premier League last term.

There is also a dedicated family concourse, generous, distributed wheelchair and easy access seats provision.
