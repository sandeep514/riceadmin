Brentford's new ground opened its doors for a competitive match for the first time on Saturday, The Brentford Community Stadium located in Kew Bridge, west London holds 17,250 people.

Premium seats - find out                                              Season Tickets, I am absolutely confident that the unique nature of the site will result in a stadium that is still different to the majority of new stadiums, is small enough to create a fantastic atmosphere yet big enough to enable the continued growth of our supporter base and offers a brilliant matchday experience for all fans.”. Irish played in Reading, Berkshire but are moving back to the capital. Bees boss Thomas Frank will be hoping his side can go one better this season after narrowly missing out on promotion to the Premier League last term. The lounges also retain a neutrality while being unmistakeably unique to Brentford Stadium – a hexagonal motif appears throughout the interiors, both referencing The Bees and the angular venue itself. Brentford Stadium balances ambition with fanbase passion and commercial viability. This new home will play a crucial role in realising our ambitions on and off the pitch.

[10], On 15 August 2016, rugby union club London Irish announced that discussions were ongoing with the borough for a move to the new stadium. [4], This was followed up in February 2008 when a partnership deal with Barratt Homes to develop the site was announced. Lighting throughout the concourses can be changed quickly from red to green. We're buzzing for it.'. Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group. Situated next to Kew Bridge station, less than a mile away from Griffin Park, it’s much more than just a stadium for professional football though. There is also a dedicated family concourse, generous, distributed wheelchair and easy access seats provision. But the west Londoners moved into their new state-of-the-art home in August next to the River Thames in Kew Bridge and the cup clash against the Chairboys is the first chance for Thomas Frank's side to test the ground at a competitive level. [17], The first football match at the stadium took place on 1 September 2020 when Brentford drew 2–2 against Oxford United in a pre-season friendly. The difference is stark. Nick Freeman and Kashket both missed from the spot as Brentford triumphed 4-2 on penalties. Our new stadium is one of the most significant and exciting developments in the history of Brentford Football Club. [8] The development agreement was signed with Willmott Dixon in December 2014. The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline. Speaking about the stadium move, Frank said: 'It's a massive boost. Brentford 's new 17,250-capacity stadium in west London welcomed its first competitive game for the Bees Carabao Cup first round tie against Wycombe Wanderers. The Bees moved less than a mile down the road from their old Griffin Park ground into the state-of-the-art 17,500-capacity Brentford Community Stadium this summer. "It's no secret that Ollie Watkins and Said Benrahma are players that other clubs are interested in and if the price is right then we're open for potentially selling them. Supporters finally have a stadium that reflects their ambitions and passion for the future of Brentford FC, and London Irish RFC can return to their home turf. Many years in the making, the stadium forms the centrepiece of a mixed-use masterplan, offering residential accommodation and regenerative opportunities.
