Following the battle, 985 miners were indicted for murder, conspiracy to commit murder, accessory to murder, and treason against the State of West Virginia. Fill the airwaves with mindless diversion and corporate propaganda. Statements and opinions expressed in articles and comments are those of the authors, not Truthdig. This “Three Days Battle” was finally ended by a flag of truce and the implementation of martial law. Given the owners hardball tactics and their alliance with the state's political powers, it's no surprising things turned ugly (though the miners certainly contributed to the bloodshed) with murders for profit and revenge, the blithe disregard of constitutional rights and law-enforcement frequently redhanded up to its elbows. We must make the powerful afraid of us if we are to get any semblance of an open and free society. The battle of Blair Mountain raised awareness of the appalling conditions faced by miners in dangerous mining operations and led directly to a change in union tactics from take up arms to taking on political actions to combat abusive and poor working conditions. Share Battle of Blair Mountain In August 1921, armed coal miners from the Kanawha Valley and the southern counties of Boone, Fayette, Mingo, McDowell, and Logan gathered at Marmet in Kanawha County. And Hatfield became a marked man. But if you see something that doesn't look right, click here to contact us! by Once Chafin heard of the miner’s decision, he began to kill union sympathizers in the town of Sharples, with women and children being caught in the crossfire. Impatient to get to the fighting, miners near St. Albans, in West Virginia's Kanawha County, commandeered a Chesapeake and Ohio freight train, renamed by the miners as the 'Blue Steel Special', to meet up with the advanced column of marchers at Danville in Boone County on their way to Bloody Mingo. "Building a Working-Class Archaeology: The Colorado Coal Field War Project". Martial law was instilled in Mingo County and resulted in unlawful persecution of union miners over small infractions. These leaders were Frank Keeney and Fred Mooney, who were veterans of previous mine conflicts in the region. Safety conditions were often deplorable, yet despite the efforts of groups such as the United Mine Workers (UMW), the mine operators had kept unions out of the region through intimidation and violence. The miners agree to return home after a long meeting in Madison. It contains music by a number of traditional artists, including Riley Baugus and Tim Eriksen. The song is contained on The Miners debut EP also entitled Miners' Rebellion. Scores of union men streamed up the mountainside, but despite their superior numbers, they were repeatedly driven back by the defenders, who riddled them with machine gun fire from the high ground. But I do call for direct and sustained confrontation with all formal mechanisms of power, including the Democratic Party. I also thought it was interesting that a lot of the miners only did it as seasonal work, and s. A year and a half of ambushes against cops and hired guns, a jury willing to acquit their fellow rabble despite evidence against them and one of the largest armed insurrections in US history - amazing. pp. In later years, after the Second World War, the larger companies sent a new generation of youthful executives into the region for the purpose of ameliorating this deeply rooted animosity, but even their Rotary-learned jocularity and genial expansiveness could not soften the bias of men whose aversion had become hardcrusted in the heat of bitter union drives.”. All true. [7] Throughout the early 20th century, West Virginia coal miners attempted to overthrow this system and engaged in a series of strikes, including the Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike of 1912, which coal operators attempted to stop through violent means. The Army was finally ordered into the coal fields in early September 1921 to quell the rebellion. (Does that really need a spoiler tag?). At least one did not explode and was recovered by the miners; it was used months later to great effect during treason and murder trials following the battle. Miners along the Little Coal River were among the first to militarize, and began actions such as patrolling and guarding the area. Logan forces fought back with a machine gun, but after three hours of heavy fire, their weapon jammed. We’d love your help. [16] That afternoon, Albert and Lee along with eleven other men set out to the Stone Mountain Coal Company property. By the end of 1925, Illinois was the only remaining unionized state which could compete, in term of soft coal production, with the others listed. Collectors and researchers to this day are still finding weapons and ammunition embedded in old trees and in rock crevices. Miners at Blair Mountain after the battle - Photo courtesy of West Virginia Mine Wars Museum History The largest armed uprising in American history since the Civil War, the Battle of Blair Mountain was the culminating event of the West Virginia Mine Wars, a series of conflicts between miners and coal operators spanning nearly a decade. Who else has sold more than 200 million... To see what your friends thought of this book, The Battle of Blair Mountain: The Story Of America's Largest Labor Uprising, Anyone interested in American history, and/or social justice, This was a good microhistory of labor and coal mining in West Virginia. Five days in late august and early September of 1921 approximately 12,000 miners confronted an army of police and strikebreakers backed by coal operators in an effort to unionize the southern coal fields of WV. The miners surged forward and briefly broke the defensive line, only to be repulsed by a fusillade of bullets from a second machine gun nest located further up the ridge. The Battle of Blair Mountain was the result of years of bitter labor disputes between the miners and coal companies of southern West Virginia. He appointed 27-year-old Sid Hatfield as town sheriff. A separate conclusion chapter would have helped clarify the context and implications, I think. … The miners surrendered. “The hatreds instilled in the union miners for their bosses and erstwhile friends were a new twisting and darkening influence in the whole society of the plateau,” wrote Harry M. Caudill in “Night Comes to the Cumberlands.” “For a whole generation of workingmen such abhorrence became second nature and was directed indiscriminately at any thing or idea originating within the offices of company officials. Chafin and his supporters had soon constructed a network of machine gun nests and trenches around Blair Mountain, a 2,000-foot peak that stood directly in the miners’ path. Union leader Bill Blizzard realized that the miners were not prepared for this type of battle and gave word on September 2nd to return home when federal troops arrived. It is the story of what was supposed to be America's largest labor uprising, set in the early 1900's in West Virginia. Soon hundreds of families were living in squalid, muddy tent encampments. One of their primary tactics of combating the union was firing union sympathizers, blacklisting them, and evicting them from their homes. The union was effectively broken. In the upper watershed of Dingess Run near the town of Sharples is the site of the largest armed US insurrection since the US Civil War. Beginning in 1870–1880, coal operators had established the company town system. Law enforcement, with the exception of a few renegades such as Hatfield, was stripped, as is true now in corporate America, of any pretense of impartiality. The miners wanted to unionize; the mine-owners didn't. When it went off he knelt. To some degree, it is important also to note that this defeat had major implications for the UMWA as a whole. Starting in the summer of 2006, Kenneth King, a local avocational archaeologist led a team of professional archaeologists to further investigate the battlefield. After spending days to assemble his private army, Chafin was not going to be denied his battle to end union attempts at organizing Logan County coal mines. The Battle of Blair Mountain was the largest labor uprising in United States history and one of the largest organized armed uprisings since the American Civil War. It is a question of master and servant.”[13][14]  The UMW set up tent colonies for the homeless miner families, and soon a mass of idle and angry miners was concentrated in a small area along the Tug Fork River. Read about it. The Battle of Blair Mountain was the culmination of a decades-long labor struggle in the southern West Virginia coalfields. For the rest of the day, the hills and hollows echoed with gunfire as the union men repeatedly attacked the defenders’ lines. In April 2008, Blair Mountain was chosen for the list of protected places on the National Register of Historic Places. All rights reserved. The southern coalfields, however, remained non-unionized bastions of coal operator power.
