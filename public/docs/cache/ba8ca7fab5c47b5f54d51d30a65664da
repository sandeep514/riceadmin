When we finally return to Shirley, she kills her hot-headed boyfriend, and there’s a bloody finale as the cops arrive. It sure doesn’t end in cannibalism as I expected it to which I have to admit was surprising to me but the direction the tale goes in is so insipid and stupid that what might’ve been a interesting way to kick off the film turned into a turgid one instead. Once again production values are of the non existent variety and the actors can barely be heard most of the time…EXCEPT for the maniacal laughing of the one brother who talks about how much he dislikes his sibling as he digs the grave. And I’ll be good god damned if he didn’t go and make not one but two films! Production values are nil, I could barely make out what anyone was saying and the cinematography is of the sort that makes your eyes tear up & burn from squinting at all of the ugly, under lit scenes of people eating sandwiches in a small ugly room.

The legend of Chester Novell Turner is a strange & compelling one indeed. He laughs constantly in an attempt to pad the running time and it becomes quite a chore to listen to him after a few minutes. Sadly he hooked up with a shady video distributor and never saw a dime from his first film so he took some time off but returned 3 years later with an idea for a new film that he would self distribute directly to retail video rental shops. So he went ahead and wrote, produced & directed something called “Devil Doll From Hell” which featured an extremely foul mouthed & horny ventriloquists dummy.

In the end I got a thrill about seeing a film that was at one time purported to be just a rumor. It also features some terrible artwork (From Ms. Jones herself) and a god awful theme song sung over the opening credits that screeches something about “Entertaining” us that just makes the entire putrid package complete.
