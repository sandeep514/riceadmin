Bleacher Report draft expert Jonathan Wasserman also noted that Niang dominated despite a lack of burst and explosion below the free-throw line: Georges Niang can't jump over a puddle.   it will apply to data controlled jointly by the NBA and WarnerMedia as well as other data controlled by WarnerMedia. </p> <p>Game 2 was headlined by Providence Friars big man Ben Bentil and Saint Joseph's Hawks forward DeAndre' Bembry, who teamed up and came away with a 109-69 victory over a squad that featured Maryland Terrapins guard Melo Trimble and Wichita State Shockers swingman Ron Baker. Top Lane Agility – 10.26 seconds - Joel Bolomboy. </p> <p>Diallo wound up making his decision during the proceedings as well, according to ESPN's Chad Ford: Both Malachi Richardson &amp; Cheick Diallo told teams in interviews today that they've decided to stay in the draft. With inside and outside scoring chops that beautifully complemented some stellar court vision, the potent perimeter playmaker continued to generate hype with a first-round selection in his sights, per Wasserman: DeAndre Bembry didn't have to play today. His play this week, as well as his testing numbers, may have pushed him toward the first round. Does this catapult Baldwin past others? Celebrate title No. 18 ⬇️. Bembry in particular looked terrific. Maybe not, but it sure doesn't hurt. National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. </p> <p>Copyright © 2020 NBA Media Ventures, LLC. All rights reserved. Played anyway, and he's ballin. On to the private workouts. Draft prospect Tacko Fall posted impressive measurements at the Draft Combine this week. Looks so comfortable in this setting. Last year’s top hand length got a lot of attention, and rightfully so. Top Shuttle Run - 2.64 seconds- Malcolm Brogdon. Moore: Georges Niang is cooking thus far. Not only did the opening day of the annual evaluation process feature anthropometric and athletic testing, but select prospects participated in full-court scrimmages to try to boost their respective draft stocks. Another NBA Draft Combine has closed in Chicago, and with that, all 30 NBA teams have a bunch of information to digest. Still, they topped the sheets this year, which is saying a lot seeing as neither player ranked in the top 20 of the Combine when it came to height. Malcolm Brogdon was one of the best players to participate in the 5-on-5 games this week, and he didn’t hurt himself with his testing numbers, either. Qi officially recorded a standing reach of 9'4 ½" to go with a 7'7 ¾" wingspan—both of which were combine-bests, according to CSNNE.com's A. Sherrod Blakeley. That height was more than an inch taller than the next-tallest prospect, which was Jakob Poetl, at 7-foot-1. The major complaints were his age after four years with the Sooners and his size. Size is now out the window, and a team drafting Hield, perhaps in the top 10, was already doing so with the understanding there isn't a ton of upside, but there is surefire production for what should be a long time. If you make a request through the WarnerMedia Privacy Center,  Over the years, the NFL and NBA drafts have helped sensationalize measurement numbers to an almost silly degree. According to ESPN.com's Chad Ford, LSU Tigers forward Ben Simmons, Duke forward Brandon Ingram, Oklahoma Sooner swingman Buddy Hield and Kentucky Wildcats shooting guard Jamal Murray were among those who did not take part in some or all parts of the afternoon. He showcased supreme athleticism and a high motor throughout his team’s two games this week. Brogdon, a 6-foot-5 guard, logged the fastest shuttle run at the Combine and only one other player, Marcus Page (2.69 seconds) came close to his mark. In an extended 20-minute run Thursday, Diallo broke out to the tune of 18 points (7-of-10 shooting), four rebounds and four blocks. All stats and info via ESPN.com unless otherwise specified. Baldwin is a physical freak who can make a huge difference on both ends of the court, hence his shooting 43 percent or better from the floor in each of his two collegiate seasons and 41 or better from deep in both, too. You don’t need all of that information, so we’ll cut off all the fat and give you all the need-to-know results. He’s one of those guys that is a sparkplug off the bench with his energy and athleticism. The 2016 NBA Draft Combine provided some wild measurements from top names.  Another big winner was Kansas Jayhawks big man Cheick Diallo, who entered the predraft process as somewhat of an unknown after averaging just three points and 2.5 rebounds in 7.5 minutes per game during his first year with in Lawrence. With this theme in mind, the 2016 NBA Draft Combine provided some important lessons on key prospects. No portion of NBA.com may be duplicated, redistributed or manipulated in any form. The 6'1'' floor general showed out with an absurd 43 ½-inch vertical leap, per the NBA Draft on Twitter, which only stands to benefit a player who steadily climbed up big boards throughout the 2015-16 season: . @D_Jay24's unofficial 43.5" max vertical leap is 4th highest ever at the #DraftCombine  https://t.co/NsyCS2aQAH.   Privacy Act, please use the links below to visit each company’s privacy center. </p> <p>It’s a great test to see how quickly a player can shift directions and it gives a look into his footwork. It's not hard to see why, when Diallo went on to parlay the strong measurements with a great performance in scrimmages, in one game posting 18 points. Still scoring at will here. Here are some of the top results from the two-day event. </p> <p>However, DraftExpress' Jonathan Givony noted not all in attendance were blown away by the gaudy vertical figures: NBA execs expressing significant skepticism about the vertical leap #s being reported due to discrepancies in standing reaches measured here. 2016 NBA Draft Combine Official Measurements: Player: Standing Reach: Wingspan: Height (Shoes) Height (No Shoes) Weight: Body Fat: Hand Width: Hand … Qi’s wingspan is the widest measurement since Rudy Gobert was marked down at 7-foor-8 ½ back at the 2013 Combine. Finally given a chance, Cheick Diallo put on a show in Chicago. Wade Baldwin IV came in huge for a point guard. The NBA Draft Combine is a multi-day showcase that takes place every May before the annual June NBA draft.At the combine, college basketball players are measured and take medical tests, are interviewed, perform various athletic tests and shooting drills, and play in five-on-five drills for an audience of National Basketball Association (NBA) coaches, general managers, and scouts.   the NBA Privacy Center, it will apply to data controlled independently by the NBA. Celebrate title No. It's a rather large flag, but a team drafting Qi does so with the understanding he's a 20-year-old project still needing to grow into his incredible frame. He weighed in at only 218.2 pounds; there were three guards who weighed more than he did. 18 ⬇️, —both of which were combine-bests, according to CSNNE.com's, ranks behind only Alexis Ajinca, Rudy Gobert and Boban Marjanovic among active NBA players. See our picks, and then tell us the one you'd build your team around ⬇️, B/R x HoH. Zhou Qi left the crowd in shock with his numbers. </p> <p>Another NBA Draft Combine has closed in Chicago, and with that, all 30 NBA teams have a bunch of information to digest. Players who shone on Day 1 will have a chance to continue proving themselves Friday, while those who fell short of expectations will have an opportunity to bounce back in style. It didn’t take long for someone from this year’s Combine to match the highest max vertical from last year’s Combine. However, it should be noted that not all of this year's top prospects participated in the day's festivities. That being said, he’s the same size as Celtics All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas (at least on paper), so he might be able to find a niche in the NBA. It's like mock drafts, though—every number has its value when viewed through the proper lens. Chief among the standouts was Iowa State's Georges Niang, who dropped 20 points on 8-of-12 shooting. That’s more than two inches shorter than Qi’s measurement. It's time to do away with the notion Buddy Hield is a smaller guard. </p> <p>The fact that Bolomboy notched this number as a 6-foot-9 big man says a lot about his athleticism. This site is operated jointly by NBA and WarnerMedia. Top Hand Length – 9.5 inches - Dedric Lawson, Ben Bentil. Top Max Vertical – 44 inches - Kay Felder. But nobody could knock his averages of 25.0 points and 5.7 boards per game last season. NBA Draft captured the incredible images: Zhou Qi, 20 years old (China), unofficially has largest wingspan (7'7.75") + standing reach (9'4.5") at '16 combine https://t.co/lJHhEbvojz. To put it into perspective, the widest wingspan that was recorded at last year’s Combine was 7-foot-5 ½ by Robert Upshaw. Furthermore, DraftExpress reported that Qi's wingspan "ranks behind only Alexis Ajinca, Rudy Gobert and Boban Marjanovic among active NBA players.".   Do Not Sell My Personal Information  | The event in Chicago was a big, big deal for Kansas forward Cheick Diallo. The 2016 NBA Draft Combine provided some wild measurements from top names. To opt out of the sale of your personal information as permitted by the California Consumer  </p> <p>It's officially the offseason. Top Height with Shoes – 7-foot-2 ¼ - Zhou Qi. The 2016 NBA Draft Combine officially got underway Thursday in Chicago, and troves of information became available as some of the nation's top collegiate and international prospects hit the hardwood. Without further adieu, here's a look at all of the key measurable numbers from Thursday's proceedings, per an official NBA release: And here's a rundown of all the key athletic testing figures from those who participated, courtesy of NBA.com's database: As far as measurements go, the most eye-popping numbers of the day belong to Chinese prospect Zhou Qi, who's currently projected as a late first-round pick by DraftExpress. </p> <p>When it comes to point guards, Wade Baldwin IV out of Vanderbilt falls behind names such as Kris Dunn and Demetrius Jackson, among others, in terms of stock.
