They will have the supermax at their disposal, and Giannis has yet to make any claims that he wants out of Milwaukee, a positive sign for the small-market franchise. What can the Warriors offer for Giannis Antetokounmpo? I focus on the strategy, salary cap and business side of the Golden State Warriors. Before joining Forbes in the summer of 2018 I wrote about the Warriors and the salary. This isn’t a new rumor, as we’ve all heard whispers about the Warriors making a play for Giannis Antetokounmpo. If the Milwaukee Bucks once again come up short of a championship, Antetokounmpo might not be too keen on signing a five-year, “supermax” extension to remain in Milwaukee. While this is the NBA where anything can happen, and sometimes statements said in the heat of a loss get re-assessed in the cold light of day, this one feels pretty definite. Giannis Antetokounmpo is quickly becoming a once in a generation player. The big catch in sign-and-trades is that they impose a hard cap on the team after the transaction for the whole of the next season. But their path is not easy. The Warriors also have Minnesota’s 2021 top-3 protected pick in the 2021 draft and a cap-hold for that salary will count against their cap-sheet as soon as they make the pick. (Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images), (Photo by Ashley Landis – Pool/Getty Images). </p> <p>All in all, that means to sign Antetokounmpo the Warriors need to clear around $85m of cap space (including additional empty roster spot charges incurred in creating the space). If Giannis Antetokounmpo truly wants to “chase greatness” as he said last week, what better organization to join than the five-time reigning Western Conference-champion Warriors? This isn’t a new rumor, as we’ve all heard whispers about the Warriors making a play for Giannis Antetokounmpo. They are going down with this ship. </p> <p>CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA - FEBRUARY 17: Giannis Antetokounmpo #34 of the Milwaukee Bucks and Team Giannis celebrates with Stephen Curry #30 of the Golden State Warriors against Team LeBron in the second quarter during the NBA All-Star game as part of the 2019 NBA All-Star Weekend at Spectrum Center on February 17, 2019 in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Golden State Warriors could be planning a possible trade for the Milwaukee Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo. They have had only one in their 52-year history who is better - Lew Alcindor, better known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. But therein lies perhaps the biggest barrier. Discussions on the future salary cap are still to come, but the expectation around league circles is that the salary cap will remain at around the current level of $109,140,000 at least for the 20-21 season and likely beyond, including the summer of 2021. </p> <p>That means Antetokounmpo would have to join a pared down roster, with just Curry and Green as co-stars. I have followed the NBA for over 25 years from the United Kingdom. </p> <p>© 2020 Forbes Media LLC. The Golden State Warriors have been rumored as a destination for over a year now, but the reality is that Antetokounmpo joining the Warriors remains unlikely. </p> <p>As reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo exits the playoffs unexpectedly early, a renewed round of speculation on his future has broken out. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images), EY & Citi On The Importance Of Resilience And Innovation, Impact 50: Investors Seeking Profit — And Pushing For Change, Antetokounmpo to Yahoo Sports’ Chris Haynes on a trade request. Here’s how Bleacher Report thinks that trade could come down, with soon-to-be back-to-back NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo heading from the Bucks to the Warriors. The best trade for both the teams would be Giannis in exchange for Draymond Green, Jordan Poole, Eric Paschall, Marquese Chriss, and Ky Bowman. Warriors Plan to Trade Giannis Antetokounmpo Via Trade Using The #2 Pick in Draft. </p> <p>This does give the Warriors a little more wiggle room. If Giannis Antetokounmpo truly wants to “chase greatness” as he said last week, what better organization to join than the five-time reigning Western Conference-champion Warriors?. 1 min ago. </p> <p>However, they still have to account for nine empty roster charges of $898,310, totalling $8,084,790. The only way Giannis is dealt is if the Bucks view they have no chance of re-signing him. </p> <p>VIEWS. Meanwhile Tim Bontemps of ESPN reported “multiple sources are adamant that the Bucks won't trade him” should Antetokounmpo turn down the mega-extension he is eligible to sign this offseason, which could be north of $220m. And if they fall short next season and he decides to leave, they will still have taken the best shot they’ll get at a championship for the foreseeable future and could still execute a sign-and-trade with another team to get some assets back. </p> <p>But Shelburne joined 95.7 The Game’s “Damon, Ratto & Kolsky” show to explain why Golden State’s assets might be too good for the Bucks to pass up. But, whether or not the Golden State Warriors would give up such high-value picks and players is unknown. </p> <p>We'll never pass along your email address to spammers, scammers, or the like. </p> <p>Their total salaries would come to $102,549,678, which is just $6,590,322 to build out the roster. </p> <p>NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and/or using this photograph, user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. </p> <p>Before joining Forbes in the summer of 2018 I wrote about the Warriors and the salary cap for the SB Nation blog Golden State of Mind. But Shelburne joined 95.7 The Game’s “Damon, Ratto & Kolsky” show to explain why Golden State’s assets might be too good for the Bucks to pass up. Defensive player of the year and two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo has been the hottest trend in the NBA as his future looks uncertain in Milwaukee. The Bucks will still demand a price. </p> <p>Antetokounmpo, Curry, and Thompson would cost … “It’s no wonder many in league circles believe Miami and Toronto are the frontrunners in the Antetokounmpo sweepstakes, with one observer telling Yahoo Sports ‘it’s an open secret’ within the Orlando bubble,” Yahoo!’s Vincent Goodwill wrote. This is not the time to cut their losses. [RUNNIN' PLAYS PODCAST: Listen to the latest episode], Milwaukee Bucks receive: Andrew Wiggins, GSW 2020 first-round pick, MIN 2021 first-round pick (top-three-protected), GSW 2022 first-round pickGolden State Warriors receive: Giannis Antetokounmpo. Add in $4,491,550 of charges empty roster spots and they’ll be around $52,069,679 over the salary cap. Plus, while Wiggins hasn't quite lived up to the hype that typically surrounds a No. However, as the weeks went by the rumor just wouldn’t go away. If the Milwaukee Bucks once again come up short of a championship, Antetokounmpo might not be too keen on signing a five-year, “supermax” extension to remain in Milwaukee. Antetokounmpo, Curry, and Thompson would cost $115,503,686, leaving $23,424,314 for the rest of the roster. </p> <p>Part of the reason the Warriors are linked so much with Antetokounmpo is because they pulled off the ultimate coup in signing Kevin Durant in 2016. </p> <p>[RELATED: Steph Curry's new Curry 7 colorway is a tribute to Warriors fans]. </p> <p>Steph Curry's new Curry 7 colorway is a tribute to Warriors fans. Like the Warriors, the Miami Heat long have been rumored as a potential landing spot for two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, if he elects to leave the Milwaukee Bucks, either by requesting a trade or eventually signing with another organization in free agency.. </p> <p>The other option is that the Warriors could try to orchestrate a sign-and-trade. </p> <p>To this point, the “Greek Freak” has given no indication that he intends to take his talents elsewhere. Your privacy is safe with us. </p> <p>The Miami Heat and Toronto Raptors are also heavily rumored to be in the mix. </p> <p>1 seed in that the East. As it stands now, the Milwaukee Bucks early exit from the 2020 playoffs hasn’t really moved the needle one way or the other for the Warriors. They will have enough cap space to sign Giannis to a bigger deal once his contract expires. </p> <p>Powered by Minute Media © 2020 All Rights Reserved. Even if Antetokounmpo doesn’t sign the extension now, he can sign it next summer. </p> <p>No-one knows yet what Antetkounmpo will want in 2021. That said, let’s dive into three ways they could make that happen. </p> <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo in Golden State remains an unlikely dream that is both costly and complex to realize. Attaching both of the Warriors 2020 and 2021 draft selections is probably a minimum, and the combined salary of Wiggins and the 2020 2nd pick is just below the limit of 125% of Antetokounmpo’s new salary (per Larry Coon’s CBAFAQ, unsigned draft picks count as $0 for salary matching purposes in trades, so the 2021 pick wouldn’t add salary). </p> <p>Even if he decides he wants to leave, a Warriors team with a 33-year-old Curry and one of Green or Thompson at 31, and pretty much nothing else, does not give him the best chance of winning multiple titles over the next half-decade. Many NBA trade rumors have suggested the possibility of the Golden State Warriors pursuing Giannis Antetokounmpo in free-agency, and now a … (This assumes they are able to dump Jordan Poole and Kevon Looney doesn’t opt in to his player option. He is dominating the league on his way to winning back-to-back MVP’s and the Golden State Warriors … All Rights Reserved, This is a BETA experience. Wiggins’ contract likely wouldn’t be an ideal match with Giannis, so general manager Bob Myers would need to do some more salary-cap maneuvering to make all the numbers line up. And they are right to do so. </p> <p>You may opt-out by. (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images). What better way for a franchise to start over than with three first-round talents and a versatile swingman who’s yet to see his 26th birthday? The instant reaction of both Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks to their disappointing 5-game loss in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals was to double down on next season.  The Bucks are taking the path the Oklahoma City Thunder took with Kevin Durant in the 2015-16 season, and Cleveland took with LeBron James in both the 2009-10 and 2017-18 seasons. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Realistically the best case scenario here is that it allows the Warriors to keep Thompson and trade Green instead. But their path is not easy. The Bucks are potentially on their way out after a few brutal games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. </p> <p>The reigning two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo has one season left on his current four-year deal, and an enormous decision to make. </p> <p>The Bucks should not trade Antetokounmpo. Not very likely. The Golden State Warriors may not want to wait for free agency to chase reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. Golden State is in position to make a pretty difficult trade offer for the Bucks to turn down should Antetokounmpo refuse their highest bid, according to Bleacher Report’s Preston Ellis. I focus on the strategy, salary cap and business side of the Golden State Warriors. Before the pandemic struck, the Warriors spent most of this season contorting themselves to keep their salary under the so-called “apron” of $138,928,000.
