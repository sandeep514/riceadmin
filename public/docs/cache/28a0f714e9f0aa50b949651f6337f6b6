Instead, we got our horror fix from the wealth of ironic, self-referential slasher films that began sprouting up in the wake of the blockbuster hit Scream. Some weird cartoon Fascist country that has a leader that can Spock pinch your shoulder and make blood come out of your nose and then you die. ""'Is it murder?' Come on. Film data from TMDb. It feels too isolated and big. Soundtracks. All of that boiling 8c1d and not a single skeleton, the poster was absolutely misleading but at least I was able to appreciate Vincent Price's incredible pink house with grey & gold accents layered throughout and the scene with two women ferociously fighting over a man's disembodied hand as if they've been in quarantine as long as me. What a spectacularly odd film this is! C: We’ve discussed how, on account of a brief lapse in judgement, I’d thought Dewey was the killer. The list…, The Grindhouse Cinema Database is an online database of cult/exploitation/grindhouse movies from the '30s to the mid/late '80s. RIP Tatum. The list…, The Grindhouse Cinema Database is an online database of cult/exploitation/grindhouse movies from the '30s to the mid/late '80s. It’s like this uncomfortable black comedy. It’s like a vast, murderer’s playground (and, well, it kind of is). You know they’re stupid to do it, but you can’t help but be disturbed by just how far out of their minds the two of them really are. It’s a stretch, yeah, but I’m sticking with Billy thinking of Stu while in bed with Sidney. Goofs I give Scream an esteemed 8.8 STABS OUT OF 10. – The 1,000 Greatest Horror Films (2018 Edition), All the films mentioned in Kim Newman's Nightmare Movies, Genre: Exploitation (100 Years: 1896-1995), New Beverly Cinema Films by Quentin Tarantino, Exploitation films, B-movie cheese, grindhouse trash, and other assorted cult cinema : A to Z. Fun fact: I can’t refer to The Howling without calling it “That werewolf movie with E.T.’s mom.” So many iconic lines in just this brief sequence. All of that boiling 8c1d and not a single skeleton, the poster was absolutely misleading but at least I was able to appreciate Vincent Price's incredible pink house with grey & gold accents layered throughout and the scene with two women ferociously fighting over a man's disembodied hand as if they've been in quarantine as long as me. T: The reveal that Billy and Stu killed Maureen makes it so much creepier than just being Ghostface. But outside of that, they must have like 10% of the films runtime or something stupid. C: I think it helps that Billy and Stu, despite the homoerotic tension, aren’t coded as queer monsters. Not every movie of his is great (*cough* Shocker *cough*) but Craven really was a masterful director with the right material. The “safety in numbers” isn’t real after all. Scream 2 was released 20 years ago. Amidst the fun Gale of it all, we get the reminder that Sidney’s worried about Neil. BUT I have some issues. scream and scream again Back to Fear Street – The Stepsister (Fear Street, #9) & R.L. I will say though, even Billy, a psycho, makes sure to get verbal consent from Sid. In honor of the film’s birthday, writer Kevin Williamson revealed some fun, alternate Scream 2 endings that never made it into the final film, including different identities for the killers. C: Sheriff Burke deserved better. Some weird cartoon Fascist country that has a leader that can Spock pinch your shoulder and make blood come out of your nose and then you die. Ladies, that’s a telltale sign of a toxic boyfriend. T: The Richard Gere gerbil urban legend is such a bizarre reference! What a spectacularly odd film this is! Kevin Bacon and an Ashmore twin in a melodrama about serial killers? He dies in the script, so that was very much a, “The character’s great, we’ll consider saving him in editing. You really get the sense that he can’t take anything seriously. It introduces three story threads to begin with - a murder investigation, a runner who has a heart attack and wakes up in a mysterious hospital and the day-to-day operations of a fictional country under fascist rule. 				Report this film. I’m so glad Billy is a psycho killer, because it makes him gaslighting Sidney about her PTSD more stomachable. The grocery store scene (to return to my comment from the first part) has always bothered me because Sidney and Tatum buy so, so, so, so much food. Had Scream not happened, Stu and his family would definitely have starred in some gritty home-invasion slasher living in a house like that. Super serious Sheriff Burke smoking while just as serious Dewey licks an ice cream cone is perfection. Check out some of the IMDb editors' favorites movies and shows to round out your Watchlist. What a spectacularly odd film this is! One day, I’ll make myself a Scream 4 fan edit and fix that egregious error. If you’re in a fix for a movie with three of the greatest horror actors sharing the screen, just watch The House of Long Shadows instead- that one’s great. C: I maybe knew I was gay when I saw this scene and thought, “I don’t want to see that.”. C: Dewey is whack for seeing Sidney as a young Meg Ryan. So we see Sidney and Billy decide to have sex and leave the scene. I made this for myself but I thought others might find it useful. They could have gone a cheap route and short some B footage of “generic slasher” and saved money, but this helps sell that Scream takes place in our world. T: Is it weird we don’t end on Sidney? so Gale shows up and distracts them long enough for Sidney to slip away and play cat and mouse with the boys, which pisses Billy off. This FAQ is empty. © Letterboxd Limited. Although I wonder why she doesn’t scream? So I guess he’s not all bad after all? Now streaming on: Powered by JustWatch. Christopher Lee talking on a turquoise phone in a fake government office. But apparently Vincent Price later admitted to having no idea what the script was about, so that makes two of us at least. C: It’s like the first thing Billy asks her, too. So that's all fun. If you’re in a fix for a movie with three of the greatest horror actors sharing the screen, just watch The House of Long Shadows instead- that one’s great. Such a class act. Not bird birds, but mod British girls. C: That’s a fair point, definitely! C: It makes for a great visual reveal, but it doesn’t make a lot of narrative sense. Maybe it’s from when Sidney slammed the door on him? C: I remember the cast describing this third as the most difficult part of filming. And even once it does wrap up, one's left with that thought of, "Okay, that makes sense, but what the fuck?". Vincent Price's screen time is minimal also, but his presence in the closing moments is so brilliantly memorable that any complaints about his absence are washed away by the fantastic ending; some great quotes in that scene uttered by Price. Needlessly overcomplicated plot that goes from absurd to just plain incomprehensible by the end. C: Some fans want him back in Scream 5, too. The real cleverness comes in that Billy’s “too obvious.”. Dewey learns Sheriff Burke is convinced Sidney’s missing dad is the culprit and is ordered to keep a close watch on Sidney. A Victorian-age scientist returns to London with his paleontological bag-of-bones discovery from Papua New Guinea. I mentioned this in part 1, but I can see his appeal for someone Sidney’s age (I would have liked him too, probably), but as I’ve gotten older, I have no patience for someone behaving the way he does. T: We’ve mentioned how much the gay community loves Scream, but how queer is it exactly - besides being created by a gay man? C: He’s such scum. T: As much as I’m like, “For a slasher movie, I’d like more deaths,” I’m so glad Wes decided to shoot footage of Dewey surviving just in case they wanted to edit that in. Sidney grabs Dewey’s gun and is confronted with a Sophie’s Choice between Randy and Stu and locks both of her close friends out. Serial Killer with super strength that prowls mod London clubs to pick up 'birds' and kill them. Billy stumbles down the stairs, still alive, takes the gun, lets Randy in and shoots Randy. Someone would definitely have said something. It's Doowie le killer. C: Spoiler for Scream 4, but it devastates me that “Red Right Hand” isn’t in it. For a film that features Cushing, Lee & Price I have no idea how it manages to be so underwhelming.There are moments of pure madness but it's a sad state of affairs when the poster turns out to be the most memorable thing about the film.Vincent Price gets to shine in the final 10 minutes but it's really too late to save this film from mediocrity. related…. If I could rename this film, I'd call it "Frankenstein Meets James Bond". C: “The sex was good and all, but, like, are you sure you didn’t try to kill me?” That’s pretty much what she did. Repeatedly. All the films mentioned by name in Kim Newman's definitive encyclopedia of horror films, Nightmare Movies. with red armbands in some kind of unnamed (I think) Eastern European country (maybe?) 					IMDb It’s just a bonus that Ghostface is behind Randy, played by a Jamie, while he says it. Alfred Marks as Supt.Bellaver is actually the star. There's an entire separate B-story running alongside the main plot that seemingly involves some kind of totalitarian military organization (?) I think it especially sticks out because it’s an entire scene without Sidney or a kill. 2. C: Definitely Billy, and that’s why we hate Billy– he killed Tatum. [News] Frightening Ass Film Festival Returns for a Virtual Edition this Halloween! I agree about the clothes, though.                 (1970). Cushing has one scene and he's not in the film again. Somehow...amazingly enough, I think if they had stuck to original idea of the military outfit in the movie being aliens instead, it would’ve been been an improvement. C: Craven just has such a huge heart. One thing I’ll give the movie credit for is casting (at the time) relative unknowns. Of course, none of these endings were ever intended to be used, and instead the film ended with the Debbie/Mickey twist, which was ultimately a huge disappointment anyway.
