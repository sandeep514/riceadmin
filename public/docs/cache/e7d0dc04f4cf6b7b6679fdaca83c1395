Almost 300 Regulators became part of the Patriot Movement, and only about 30 claimed loyalty to the British Crown. In 1768, the Regulators entered Hillsborough, broke up the court, and dragged those they saw as corrupt officials through the streets. Due to income loss, the local planters often fell into debt. He refused to take command of the Regulators after Husband's departure before the Battle of Alamance. Herman Husbandbecame one of the unofficial leaders of the Regulators. Following this battle, a few Regulators were hanged and the majority pardoned, bringing the movement to an end. Charles Woodmason argued their case. Each document identified concerns and issues relevant to the Regulator Movement. Debts were common at the time, and from 1755 to 1765, the cases brought to the docket increased nearly sixteen-fold, from seven annually to 111 in Orange County, North Carolina, alone. By then, most of the leaders of the Regulator Movement were either dead, in exile, or in hiding, and the rebellion's ordinary soldiers were scattered and disheartened. Governor Tryon and his forces, which numbered just over 1,000, with roughly 150 officers, arrived at Hillsborough on May 9. A number of influential members of the area communities signed the Regulator Advertisement and the Regulator Petition, of which there were several versions of each. These regulators found an enemy in local groups of "hunters" (who were seen as undesirables) and bandits. 1989. The Regulators sought a public meeting with colonial officials to discover "whether the free men of this [Orange] county labor under any abuses of power or not." Indeed, Presbyterians were instrumental in helping raise troops to fight the Regulators, and a portion of Baptists excommunicated those who had taken part in the unrest. North Carolina through four centuries. Bassett's view is that the Regulators did not wish to change the form or principle of their government, but simply wanted to make the colony's political process more equal.

Coupled with the 1769 ordinance for the preservation of deer, which forbade fire hunting, the new law resulted in many hunters being whipped and banished from the area. When the British government suggested that the Assembly enact a general amnesty, the two Houses could not agree on its terms and the proposal failed to pass. Thirty-one owned slaves, and 14 owned 10 or more.

Governor Josiah Martin succeeded Governor Tryon in office just after the end of the rebellion. Merchants and lawyers began to move west, upsetting the social and political structure. Bassett also downplays the role played by Herman Husband, the Quaker pamphleteer who is often identified as one of the movement's leaders. North Carolina's colonial court met in Hillsborough. Following the battle, Tryon's militia army traveled through Regulator territory, where he had Regulators and Regulator sympathizers sign loyalty oaths and destroyed the properties of the most active Regulators. William Tryon succeeded him.

Some formed a settlement on the banks of the Mississippi River near the site of Memphis, but later, when some of Tryon's former militiamen appeared in their midst, they packed up and moved farther away. A small clique of wealthy officials formed an exclusive inner circle in charge of the legal affairs of the area. Pictorial Fieldbook of the Revolution.

The presiding Judge Richard Henderson quickly adjourned the court until the next morning to avoid being forced to make a ruling in the presence of an angry mob of Regulators, and escaped in the night. Husband retained very little control over the Regulators, who generally went against his policies of winning over public sentiment and committed act… Powell, William S., James K. Huhta, and Thomas J. Farnham (eds).

The bandits gathered until they numbered about 200. [6], At the time of their defeat at Alamance, public opinion was decidedly against the Regulators. The group was seen as a 'courthouse ring' made up of officials who grabbed most of the political power for themselves.     [Washington]: [Govt. At the same time, General Hugh Waddell, supporting the governor, en route with his contingent of 236 men was met by a large contingent of Regulators under the leadership of Captain Benjamin Merrill. When they made no response, Tryon sent an officer to say that unless they disbanded promptly he would fire on them.
