He is the Antichrist, the future despot who comes in the name of the ancient mystery religion.”A year earlier, in June of 2000, Stearman had written in Prophecy in the News concerning Nimrod: “He was a rebel who allowed himself to be worshipped as a god. In the article Sandpit of Royalty from the newspaper Extra Bladet (Copenhagen), January 31, 1999, Hawass was quoted saying: “I have found a shaft, going 29 meters vertically down into the ground, exactly halfway between the Chefren Pyramid and the Sphinx. In ancient writings from Mesopotamia, the name of Gilgamesh appears in different forms like Bilgames. The tablet exemplifies the unity between Enkidu and Gilgamesh to fight the demon of Humbaba. Some of the epic fragments found in Tell Haddad demonstrate Gilgamesh burial. A place to discuss and share thoughts about the work of Robert Sepehr. Now, a German-led expedition has discovered what is thought to be the entire city of Uruk - including, where the Euphrates once flowed, the last resting place of its famous King. However, it seems that the excavation had to be stopped due to the numerous conflicts of the nation. It is quite likely that Gilgamesh was a real person. Ideally, the language of the Sumerians is used figuratively in expressing Akkadian that makes an abrupt opaque passage (Jones, 2011). This epic poem is noted for being the first known work of narrative fiction ever produced. Stone tablet inscribed with the Sumerian King List.

Picard takes this a challenge to a fight and throws the knife back to him. The poem … Like Creation? © 2020               Created by truth. This is because as interbreeding begins between transgenic animals, genetically modified humans, and specie as God made them, the altered DNA will quickly migrate into the natural environment, and when that happens (as is already occurring among genetically modified plants and animals), ‘alien’ and/or animal characteristics will be introduced to the human gene pool and spread through intermarriage, altering the human genetic code and eventually eliminating humanity as we know it. According to Foster, (2014), most scholars who have encountered sources on the life and legend of Gilgamesh, use different approaches. Although Gilgamesh is open to embrace it as though it were his wife, his mother forces a coemption between the meteorite and Gilgamesh (Ilnitzki, n.d.).

Clay tablets found in tombs are inscribed with prayers to Gilgamesh asking for lenient judgment, suggesting that the King had become a judge of the Underworld (Inanna famously descended into and returned from Kur, the Sumerian underworld). The sun-god intervenes in favor of Gilgamesh and Enkidu who acquire victory against Humbaba. Gilgamesh is the name of a legendary warrior king, a figure based on the fifth king of the first dynasty of the Mesopotamian capital of Uruk, sometime between 2700–2500 BCE. Furthermore, Gilgamesh is listed as one of the kings of Uruk by the Sumerian King List. According to Louis Pauwells & Jacques Bergier in The Dawn of Magic (first published in France under the title “Le Matin des Magiciens” 1960 by Editions Gallimard, Paris), this was certainly the goal of the antichrist Adolf Hitler: Hitler’s aim was neither the founding of a race of supermen, nor the conquest of the world; these were only means towards the realization of the great work he dreamed of.

And those kind of things the Materialist, Darwinist, Naturalists, like official academia, and WP, and Dawkins et al, sorely despise! CQ Columnist Mark Stencel listened to the recent HFA committee hearings and wrote in his March 15, 2009 article, Futurist: Genes Without Borders, that the conference “sounded more like a Hollywood pitch for a sci-fi thriller than a sober discussion of scientific reality… with talk of biotech’s potential for creating supersoldiers, superintelligence and superanimals [that] agents of unprecedented lethal force.” [1]. Overlooking Enkidu, Humbaba taunts the King for taking orders from nobody. Gilgamesh and Enkidu begin to cut the trees and Humbaba, the guardian, hears the sound and comes running with a roar to warn them off (Haubold, 2014). That’s why Uruk’s king Gligamesh, mourning Enkidu’s death, went up the mountains of Ararat where the Ark landed and Noah obviously still lived then, to find out why he lived so long and outlived younger generations! New scientific findings suggest that images and hieroglyphics on the wooden statue were carved with the jaw of a beaver, its teeth intact.

His legendary exploits are questionable, however. Naupa Iglesia: An Egyptian Portal in the Andes? Floki and the Viking Discovery of Iceland, 3 Problems to Remember When Trying to Find Atlantis. And why? Writer and researcher Mehmet Törehan Serdar said his team has determined the location of the tomb after an extensive period of research. During the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, pre-Maccabean fragments of the Book of Enoch were found, helping scholars to verify the book’s antiquity while also illustrating that the ancients held these texts to be inspired. The tablets explain the tale of the voyage to the cider forest. The information in the tablet informs of the society’s religious beliefs, political order and economic status. (2014). Shamash directs Gilgamesh to kill Humbaba when he is not wearing his armor of seven coats. After all they were the immdiate descendents of stupid cavemen and hunter gatherers!
