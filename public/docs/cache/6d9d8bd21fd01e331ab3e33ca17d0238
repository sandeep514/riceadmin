All three conditions are the result of his wife’s untimely demise. they really fit with the film and reinforced the story. It includes the foretelling of three additional events, the last of which hints at destruction on a global scale. Special Effects where not over the top. It also analyses reviews to verify trustworthiness. As it is, Knowing is a fascinating and beautiful movie that ends really poorly. For me, it doesn't quite work; still I'm glad he took the risk. Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 May 2020, Nic Cage’s typical rendition of being slightly dazed and convincingly confused fits perfectly in KNOWING. the whole cast worked well. It stars Nicolas Cage, Rose Byrne, Chandler Canterbury, Lara Robinson, Ben Mendelsohn and Nadia Townsend. Helpful. Sign up for FLICKS weekly updates - what's new & awesome in cinemas.

He can really bring emotion to the scene and there are many. It ranks alongside Tony Scott's predictable sci-fi bore DEJA VU and joins Nic Cage's ever expanding catalogue of... Genre fans always looking for something new and awesome may feel like they've seen most of this before, but the conceptual and emotional strength of Summit's Nicolas Cage starrer largely carries the day. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Simon Duggan. Some nice cgi and some bizarre - was that a moose... in flames?

Nicholas Cage plays professor Ted Myles, who discovers a coded set of numbers in a time capsule dug up at his son's primary school. nick cage is the usual self but it does fit in this film. Full review. Directed by Aussie Alex Proyas (I, Robot, Dark City).  Director Alex Proyas resolutely thinks in B-movie terms. Approved third parties also use these tools in connection with our display of ads. Academy Award® Winner Nicolas Cage (National Treasure: Book of Secrets, Leaving Las Vegas) stars in KNOWING, a gripping action-thriller of global proportions about a professor who stumbles on terrifying predictions about the future and sets out to prevent them from coming true. In truth, however, Knowing has a far more insidious agenda: to convince non-believers like Cage, an embittered, alcoholic atheist since his wife’s death, there is intelligent design in the universe. Ted works out that the code predicts the dates, death tolls and coordinates of every major disaster of the past fifty years. I'm not going to pretend this is some masterpiece or a movie which I should be highly critical of. I enjoyed the premise and the story in general. Ted's attempt to alert the authorities falls on deaf ears, so he takes it upon himself to try and prevent the disasters. As a committed atheist I found this late aspect to be less than welcome. I was drawn to this film in seeing there was an astro physicist and that decoding numbers from the past was important… As a student of science and maths, it was very interesting! 2.0. Another rubbish performance by Nicholas Cage. The supernatural undertones and where it gets its thriller genre tag is sort of a let down for me. Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 July 2017.

Trevor Holmes. AKA: Presagio, Presságio, Знамення, Know1ng. The plot itself is reasonably good until at the end when it attempts to introduce a religious justification for all that went before. This is what will appear next to your ratings and reviews. It’s a religious movie, and if we have no God, then there is no purpose to our lives. It would be unjust to reduce this film's rating to two star simply because Nicholas Cage was the star.

The fact I was in near hysterics as the credits rolled was not a good sign, given this film is meant to be an end-of-the-world disaster movie, not a comedy. Ruined. Knowing is everything....

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2015. Alex Proyas directed the excellent CROW and the interesting DARK CITY and then the big dumb dull popcorn epic I ROBOT and then this sorry excuse for a sci-fi actioner. If you’re religious and enjoy a doomed prophecy, then this is for you. 4.0 out of 5 stars Great end of the world story (sorry--is that a spoiler?) Even with an A-list budget, he oversells every plot point and gooses the thrills with hokey lighting, bombastic music and serious overacting. It’s one of those genre-bending films which spans several categories, with aspects of everything from Amityville to Armageddon via A Beautiful Mind and Babylon 5. Keep track of the movies you’re waiting for, rate/review movies and get the latest movie news. Nicholas Cage plays a slightly mad, agnostic, alcoholic single dad. I would say it felt a little bit rushed and lacks substance, there could have been romance there, but that was I assume purposefully avoided, which I wonder why because it still went with the overused whispers and spiritual assertions. Select the department you want to search in. Loses its uniqueness when it takes such a direction,and more so over used methods. Try again. Its a mystery movie. I gave this a 4 because it does feel drawn out (could have been shorter). If you’re atheist and prefer science, and want to see superb scientific achievement against adversity, this isn’t for you. Supernatural doesn't quite mix with Science fiction, but it's okay. You definitely can’t pigeonhole this one…, Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 June 2017. yes this is a good movie.
