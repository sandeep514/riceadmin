I missed the part about the poison but as others said, I think Radic never left that room then AG came in there too. If I was a betting man I would have to say she was just playing the part. Upload subtitles . She is also the older sister, and the not the daughter of Radic. Or probably, a better reason, is as a coping mechanism for losing her family and her sister? When she slipped on the scarf however, I do stuff like that all the time and I can see, so I still buy her being able to see. In the car Radic said that when he strangled her mother, when she finally died he knew that she could see who he was. There's also some sexual content.Karen is a teenager with impaired vision. She uses her eyes, which have worked perfectly well the entire movie long, and she hustles over to help him. I think she thought that would eventually let her get close to him again, and also helped her to seem vulnerable. Just to feel connected to her daughter? This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Also, she had told Naill that she was going to spend her life avenging her family’s murders. Yes, the last minute not the blind girl twist makes no sense considering all her actions in the film. It is my understanding that Alex was working with Veronique to take down Radic, but she was also working for Radic as some kind of fixer. He obviously had fell in love with her for her to be 3 months pregnant with his child. Over all I liked the movie and the twist. That is why after her whole family died that was probably her coping method to keep going as a blind person and then somehow going after Radic, which she had been doing for years. And with that, you should be sold on this movie. No thank you. But not everyone universally loved it. 2014  (Which, is learned later, is the password for the thumb drive.) I liked the movie but the ending was a bit lame. The photography is by Gordon ("The Prince of Darkness") Willis, who shot "The Godfather" movies and specializes in deep shadows and murky gloom. The only time she lets her guard down is once when she sees Marc’s fuzzy poster and leaves the Police Station and the second time is when she notices Marc has been stabbed and has lost alot of blood. The tension only escalates when Karen encounters their off-the-grid, squatter neighbor "Ted" in the wooded area around the home.You think what you're getting is the story of a defenseless young girl at the mercy of a dangerous stranger out in the woods, but its not nearly that clear cut. A young girl seeks revenge after an unexpected death, while the world around her unravels revealing horrifying secrets about her life and family. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. just finished re-watching the movie as I’d forgotten everything, apparently, from months ago when I first started it…….NOT a movie to watch while you’re trying to exercise(! Makes more sense to me now. Welcome back to THiNC. Right? And that happens when Sofia meets with Naill, her long time protector, and we learn there is a lot more going on in her life. Cast: Angelina Prendergast - Grace Zabriskie - Grim Hans-Christian Bernhoft - Tim Bagley - Travis Andre Ross. Just watched the movie and could not wrap my brain around what actually happened. When the story comes to its crescendo, you're left wondering whats real and whats not. Required fields are marked *. In Darkness Movie Deep Dive and Explanation. She started acting blind because of Veronique to get close to Radic to kill him. Sofia smashes a vase, or some other break away glass thing, on Radic’s face. Yes it makes sense that the flashbacks were actually his and not hers. Also I don’t understand how everyone here knows that the sister who survived the shooting was the non-blind one. She was well established in her career of being a blind pianist. Alex was Silver as her initials were AG (Ag = chemical symbol for Silver) and Veronique was Gold. Is that a bureau? It sort of has a similar feel to The Invisible Person In The Room, or maybe Shimmer Lake? My apologies. Learn how your comment data is processed. Andy's offer is genuine, which indicates that, even though he is a college dean, his elevator doesn't go all the way to the top floor. So well do Jed and Andy get along that Andy offers to rent him the upstairs bedroom in their Victorian house, an offer the doctor eagerly accepts. No, she wasn’t his daughter. That is how she got invited to his private room at the benefit dinner. ?purposely on the stairs, not reacting to the flash of a hand in her face, not reacting to a guy in her room with a gun? See what I did there? I just figured the one coming out of the wardrobe was the blind sister. They show her looking at him slightly each time out of the corner of her eye in the flash backs. And when he talked about seeing Veronique cry near the open balcony I couldn’t figure out if it was from the conversation where she asked him to run away with her or if it was the last thing he saw before she jumped. This FAQ is empty. A young man spends his vacation at his estranged aunt's secluded country home, soon discovering that she has imprisoned her daughter under suspicion of a dangerous mental illness. Then another shock restores her blindness? Thanks so much for this explanation. It gets very disturbingly violent for a while. Blind Malice is a fairly good murder mystery, and the way it's filmed and edited puts the viewer in the lead actress' place pretty well. Then she spent the next 24 years hunting Radic down, and looking for a chance to get close to the man that killed her family. Instead it ends up in the bin of run-of-the-mill psychological horror that tries to hard to be deep and impactful, when most of the time simple is better. Personally, I don’t think Sofia should have shown surprise at the end. Metacritic Reviews. But, I agree that was bad editing and definitely confusing. Great!) In this anemic thriller from writer/director Graham Streeter,a nearly blind(with darkly blurry eyesight) teen gal(Angelica Prendergast[DisCONNECTED) with an attitude travels with her chain smoking grandmother(Grace Zabriskie[WILD AT HEART,CHILD'S PLAY 2]) to a remote weekend cabin where Zabriskie spends her time quarreling with Prendergast while hanging out outside continuing to chain smoke while Prendergast gets to know the cabin well … I’m sure you’ve got something up your sleeve…, But if she really could see, then why didn’t she see the poison the first time she meets Ravic ? Regarding ‘Sophia’s’ blindness, I’m going to go with a case of hysterical blindness – at some point after the slaughter of her family, she literally took on her sister’s identity unconsciously, including her blindness. Movie was great without it. If you are hoping for lazy entertainment? Was that an under cover movie recommendation? ...                See full summary », Karen, a visually impaired teen (Angelina Prendergast) and her grandmother (Grace Zabriskie) make a routine visit to clean the family-owned rental property. Your email address will not be published. What is their relation to radic and Sofia? Sad tho that Veronique would feel that suicide was a solution to anything. But these are movies that will make you THiNC. Malice is a 1993 neo-noir thriller film directed by Harold Becker, written by Aaron Sorkin and Scott Frank, and starring Alec Baldwin, Nicole Kidman, Bill Pullman, Anne Bancroft and George C. Scott. What’s puzzling is that it didn’t seem like a mortal wound at all, and nothing says Marc is indeed dead when the cop walks in. A fishing community on a remote Maine island finds itself suddenly cut off from the rest of the world after the ferry stops coming. I think Sofia pretended to be blind the entire time. Because of this, I would suggest NOT reading any spoilers until you watch it. Happily, Redic is dead… and she doesn’t have the guilt of his passing on her hands. But her sister was. Remember, Silver & Gold? 					 Maybe she wanted Marc to know that she wouldn’t give him the pleasure of killing her bc Marc later said in the movie that Veronique would NOT listen to him when he tried to explain that he was there to SAVE her, not kill her. Was it just bad editing… coupled with bad acting. But in that moment, he realizes that she can see. Thanks for that. You see him figure it out right then and then meet her eyes so she knows he knows. Really, you can’t make sense of the number of contradictions of her acting blind, with her demeanor, tripping ?? I think the scene of Sofia and Marc hooking up was very ill placed. Sofia is not radic’s daughter, her little sister was. Just seen this film. This is why AG tells Marc “remember it was your hands that killed her” (or something like that). Alex and Veronique had code names. And ultimately, Sofia is about to kill Radic, when Marc throws him out a window. It would be what I would consider to be a genuinely great plot twist, and I wish they’d actually meant it and gone with it instead of what they did do, which felt lazy and/or confusing (maybe a budgeting or timing issue came up? It would annoy the other passengers. (Readers? As a child she spent a lot of time blind folded by her mother so she and her sister would be on an equal footing. I thought the movie was decent but the plot was better executed in the movie House of a Thousand Daggers. This weekends movie pick has been on my watch-list now for at least two years and we finally got around to giving Blind Malice a chance. Perhaps finding she’s ‘his’ daughter…?
