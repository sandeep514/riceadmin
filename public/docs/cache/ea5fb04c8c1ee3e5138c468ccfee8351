All Critics (46) "[47] Leonard Maltin stated that it is now "considered the definitive screwball comedy, and one of the fastest, funniest films ever made; grand performances by all. Katharine Hepburn served high tea every day at four.                         |, June 15, 2011 The film's reputation began to grow during the 1950s, when it was first shown on television. Olga was born in Sweden in the late 1880’s and began working with animals at the age of 11. The big cat was supervised by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood by with a whip during shooting. Among homosexuals, the word first came into its current use during the 1920s or possibly even earlier, though it was not popularly known as a slang term for homosexuality until the late 1960s. Neissa’s character, Baby, was portrayed as a sweet and affectionate cat with a touch of wild precociousness. [7] The Bringing Up Baby script underwent several changes, and at one point there was an elaborate pie fight, inspired by Mack Sennett films. On her part, Katharine Hepburn displayed no signs of being terrified. At that, she took Hawks aside and told him not to talk to her like that because she had a lot of friends working on the film. David's response to Aunt Elizabeth asking him why he is wearing a woman's dressing gown ("Because I just went gay all of a sudden!") Howard Hawks modeled Cary Grant's character, David, on silent film comedian Harold Lloyd, even having Grant wear glasses like the comedian. Hawks built Grant's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration. Hawks mentioned this to Hepburn, who immediately marched over to ask Catlett for advice. Directed by Howard Hawks. Production had to wait until mid-September to clear the rights for "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby" for $1,000. The script contains an expression that was very common in the USA up until about the 1950s that by current standards is absolutely unbelievable and (thankfully) would never be used today.                      "Well," I said, "supposing she asks you to tell her?" Hepburn took Hawks aside, telling him never to talk to her like that again since she was old friends with most of the crew.             | Rotten (3). [12] Nichols was in touch with Ford during the screenwriting, and the film included such members of the John Ford Stock Company as Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald, D'Arcy Corrigan and associate producer Cliff Reid. During the filming, Hawks would refer to four different versions of the film's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue. In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted it the 47th-greatest comedy film of all time. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing her that he was funnier when he was serious. It is ironic that this enjoyable film flopped when it was still original and now is highly regarded as a masterpiece when it is obviously outdated and full of silly gags for today's standards - and despite her great chemistry with Grant, Hepburn is more irritating than funny.                         |, June 26, 2007                         | Rating: A Ronald Colman, Fredric March and Ray Milland were all offered the role of David Huxley. [16] Grant then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving. [30][31], Most shooting was done at the Arthur Ranch in the San Fernando Valley, which was used as Aunt Elizabeth's estate for interior and exterior scenes. Cary Grant was not fond of the tame leopard that was used in the film. Premiere ranked Cary Grant's performance as Dr. David Huxley 68th on its list of 100 all-time greatest performances,[63] and ranked Susan Vance 21st on its list of 100 all-time greatest movie characters. is considered by many film historians to be the first use of the word "gay" in its roughly modern sense (as opposed to its original meaning of "happy, carefree") in an American studio film.                      Much of the comic persona of Susan Vance was based on the zany characters played by Marion Davies in silent films and talkies. Sign up here. If there can be any criticism (and really, it's hard to take too critical a glance at something so lightweight), it may be with Hepburn and her portrayal of Susan Vance. Verified reviews are considered more trustworthy by fellow moviegoers. I realize it looks odd...I don't usually...I mean, I don't own one of these". Celle-ci, excentrique, veut attirer l'attention du scientifique alors que « Bébé », léopard apprivoisé, se trouve remplacé par un autre, sauvage, qui provoque des catastrophes. David est devenu. When he was particularly pleased with one scene, he brought the cast two cases of champagne. [53] In the commentary track for Bringing Up Baby, Bogdanovich discusses how the coat-ripping scene in What's Up, Doc? At one point, when Hepburn spun around (causing her skirt to twirl) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. He was so terrified of Neissa that the director Howard Hawkes had to come up with creative shots so that Cary and Neissa never actually acted together in any one scene. [20], In the film, the line was an ad-lib by Grant and not in any version of the original script. Concerned about Katharine Hepburn's bad press, RKO decided to shelve the project before spending any additional money on editing, scoring and advertising. It's their highest-rated comedy on AFI's 100 Funniest Comedies List (#14) and the only Howard Hawks movie on both AFI lists in 1998 and 2007 of the top 100 greatest movies of all time. Hawks told Peter Bogdanovich, "You get more pace if you pace the actors quickly within the frame rather than cross cutting fast". The censor's only objections were to the scene where Hepburn's dress is torn, and references to politicians (such as Al Smith and Jim Farley). Filming began in September 1937 and wrapped in January 1938; it was over schedule and over budget. He … Légende : 1er doublage (1941) / 2nd doublage (1988). [50] Following its second run, the film made a profit of $163,000.                         |, February 10, 2014 For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the "intercostal clavicle." [51], During its first run, Bringing Up Baby made $715,000 in the U.S. and $394,000 in foreign markets for a total of $1,109,000;[36] its reissue in 1940 and 1941 made an additional $95,000 in the US and $55,000 in foreign markets. After she talks him into forgiving her without him saying a word about anything but halfheartedly complaining about the loss of his years of work putting together the Brontosaurus skeleton, David, resigning himself to a future of chaos, embraces Susan. Hepburn also asked Hawks to give Catlett a role in the film so she could call on him for further help. "If they don't try to be funny, then they are funny. The theatrical trailer is made up mostly of unused alternate takes of the scenes in the film. It was released by RKO Radio Pictures. A tame leopard was used during the shooting; its trainer was off-screen with a whip for all of its scenes. Most of the split screen shots involved a lot of movement, which necessitated moving the dividing line as well. [14], Filming was initially scheduled to begin on September 1, 1937 and wrap on October 31, but was delayed for several reasons. I liked this film for both its big 'laugh out loud' moments (which still work after all these years), as well as the little things in the script and performances. Ford was a friend of Howard Hawks, and visited the set.                      We won’t be able to verify your ticket today, but it’s great to know for the future. [54], Bringing Up Baby was the second of four films starring Grant and Hepburn; the others were Sylvia Scarlett (1935), Holiday (1938) and The Philadelphia Story (1940). 'Bringing Up Baby' is a frenzy of running around, unexpected pratfalls, and clever dialog. He said, 'Yeah.'                      David is attempting to obtain a … Because of his critically praised work with Katharine Hepburn on Sylvia Scarlett (1935), RKO executive Pandro S. Berman convinced Cary Grant to join the cast. [16], Shooting began September 23, 1937, and was scheduled to end November 20, 1937,[28] on a budget of $767,676. Grant is not so bad himself, with that suave accent in a nerdy role, finding himself helplessly drawn into Hepburn's crazy world. In the same year it also rated Cary Grant's performance of Dr. David Huxley number 68 on the list of "The 100 Greatest Performances of All Time.". This is most evident after Susan gets the Leopard dragged into the jail. They also put resin on the bottom of Hepburn's shoes so that she wouldn't slip and startle the leopard. Don’t worry, it won’t take long. It's hard for her to make a wrong turn. Robert MacGowan was hired by RKO to write gags for this film. RKO borrowed Charles Ruggles from Paramount for the film.
