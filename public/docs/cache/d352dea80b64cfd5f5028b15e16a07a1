There are some difficult circumstances my family and friends have been going through over the past year or so and it can be overwhelming. 		artist: "The Fray", “Lost and insecure The lead singer has said the following: (From Wiki) "You Found Me is a tough song for me. Jonathan, his wife Lori, and their three kids live in California. You Found Me was written by The Fray front man Isaac Slade as part of the band's 2008 self-titled release. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”, 17 While he was still speaking, a third messenger arrived with this news: “Three bands of Chaldean raiders have stolen your camels and killed your servants. So he asks why did God take so much time to show himself to him? he starts calling him and shouting in his face blaming him for everything that happened to him because its easier than blaming himself, it eases he pain a little bit. Losing her, Isaac Slade continues his questions toward God. The city breaks, On the February 7, 2009, issue of Billboard magazine, the single jumped to number eight on the strength of a 91% digital single sales increase from the previous week and steady airplay gains on several radio formats, becoming The Fray's third career Billboard Hot 100 top ten hit after "Over My Head (Cable Car)" and "How to Save a Life". ), (Give students a few minutes to complete this exercise.). Personally I love this song, and even though some Christians are against it, I am Christian and it's one of my favorite songs. Where were you? We'll struggle, we'll fall, we'll cry, we'll fight, and we'll question, but God always finds us, picks us up and will always accept us with open and loving arms. Slade said he discussed with God where He was when all of the bad things had happened to him and other undeserving people. Assuming you're aware of how he'd spent his final years, the few remaining years of what could be described as a slow suicide, what with the loss of the love of his life and all.. He said 'Ask anything." Where were you? It wears on me. Losing her, the only one who's ever known who I am, who I'm not, who I wanna be. Everything might not be back to normal from tomorrow for Isaac. Who I want to be, This describes how people finally decide to help the narrator, but it is too late because the narrator has already given up. "[12], In a Reuters article about the album, Slade stated that the lyrics for "You Found Me" were written in 2007, and that the song asks about the problem of evil, why bad things happen to good people, after some of their friends and family went through very tough times. In an interview, Isaac Slade expressed his meaning behind the lyrics of the song: "You Found Me" is a tough song for me. "You Found Me" is a song by American rock band The Fray.It was released in November 2008 as the lead single from their eponymous second studio album.Live performances of the song from concerts in Europe surfaced on YouTube in late 2007, when the song was titled "Amistad". 1, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=You_Found_Me&oldid=962022689, Billboard Adult Top 40 number-one singles, Pages containing links to subscription-only content, Short description is different from Wikidata, Pages using infobox song with unknown parameters, Singlechart usages for Billboardeuropeanhot100, Singlechart usages for Billboardjapanhot100, Singlechart usages for Billboardadultalternativesongs, Singlechart usages for Billboardadultcontemporary, Singlechart usages for Billboardadultpopsongs, Singlechart usages for Billboardalternativesongs, Singlechart usages for Billboardchristiansongs, Certification Table Entry usages for Australia, Certification Table Entry usages for Canada, Certification Table Entry usages for United Kingdom, Certification Table Entry usages for United States, Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License, This page was last edited on 11 June 2020, at 17:22. want to try n interpret the lyrics FINE,but let's I imagined what I’d say to God, in the face of all the crap my friends have gone through in the last couple of years.”. i think the song is about him losing someone he loved when he thought that he could save her hence the "lying on the floor". Same interpretation. Lying on the floor, So he went ahead and killed himself. Just a little late, you found me, you found me." However, having said that, if you listen to the song, you notice that God did find him but it wasn't in his timing, on his plan. (Chorus)  Where were you?Just a little late, you found me, you found me. On the Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart, the song reached number one, making it their third top five hit and second number one on that chart. I am the founder and lead author and editor of Justrandomthings music community. Sometimes you're let down, sometimes you're the one who lets someone else down. It's about a man who committed suicide. He just wishes they had thought to come check on him while he was alive. And that's when he says to God, "where were you?" 19 Suddenly, a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and hit the house on all sides. ), ‘You Found Me’ brings up one of the toughest questions people ask God: ‘Where is God when bad things happen?’  Right now, we’re going to take a moment and write something that NO ONE ELSE will see: The times in our lives that have caused us to question or even doubt God. A friend had suffered a miscarriage, I had lost my grandfather. Isaac Slade finally met God. In an interview, Isaac Slade expressed his meaning behind the lyrics of the song: "You Found Me" It's about the disappointment, the heart ache, the let down that comes with life. Live performances of the song from concerts in Europe surfaced on YouTube in late 2007, when the song was titled "Amistad". He meets God, and asks where he was all this time, why he never bothered to help. No way to know, The lead singer has said the following: (From Wiki), "You Found Me is a tough song for me. It is a daunting task to imagine losing the one who has been through thick and thin with you, and the one who knows you in and out. This song is about that feeling, and the hope that I still have, buried deep in my chest."[11]. Will have to use this sometime.. The video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFg_8u87zT0, (P.S: Mods, I believe there are many people out there who are mystified by the lyrics. Like He dangles you from a thread, drops you, and then catches you at the last minute and gets worshipped for it. AROUND THE CIRCLE: Before we begin, let’s each of us say our names and favorite CDs at the moment. Meaning of found. I think when he says god he means he is just looking for help in the first part, i do not think the whole song is about god though. Same interpretation. That never rang, A friend had suffered a miscarriage, I had lost my grandfather. He Lost someone he really Loved his world and think alot of us feel this way but it's Gods timing not ours we obviously shouldn't question God but we can feel that way when losing someone God did find him and thats great Amen:). The video ends with all material objects being lifted into the air. But this time he  took more , he ruined his relationship with that girl. i saw you guys in indiana on the 11th of august <3 the fray always, I think this song is partially about suicide, partially about doubting God. I said where you been? And all I needed was a call God never came, never answered his prayers, and never helped him when he needed it.
