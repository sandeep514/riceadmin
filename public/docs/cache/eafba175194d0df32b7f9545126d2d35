Ranchi, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate EditionDirector  - Zack SnyderCast - Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jesse Eisenberg, Amy AdamsRating - 3.5/5. I'm just going to pretend that the nonsensical dreams and premonitions Batman had didn't happen. Unfortunately, upon its release, the critics dug their claws in, criticising the film for being long, complicated, and shoehorning in dozens of characters and plot lines. Whatever. Or at least, that’s how it’s being marketed. I love the dark Knight trilogy, animated series, novels and the video games over the years I have learned what makes batman, Batman.

What's more interesting is that the key character of the story is both lex luthor and Lois lane as they are the gaps to fill the narration. <br> <br>Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2020. Fortunately, the Ultimate Edition improves upon many of the film's biggest narrative shortcomings - clarifying and/or outright answering a number of questions that had, previously, presented major plot holes and often undermined the intelligence and integrity of Batman V Superman's starring heroes.

Zack Snyder could never have anticipated it. My son hates Superman, but I like him. Neither is it about Warner Bros. vs Disney or any other movie studio; WB is the company behind the fantastic The Dark Knight trilogy, after all.

NOTE: The following is not a revised Dawn of Justice review (read our full Batman V Superman review), not a formal review of the Ultimate Edition, nor a review of home release special features or commentaries. Nevertheless, viewers who are willing to invest the time will get a much better (though still imperfect) Batman V Superman movie experience - one that should, for viewers who still have an open mind about Snyder's work in the DCEU, restore a bit more confidence in the filmmaker ahead of Justice League. The response to the film from critics was brutal; the fans, less so, but still divided.

A Good Watch, But Falls Short of Being Great, Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2018. Not this guy. It’s ironic that in a film so monumentally huge, all it took to destroy it were the tiniest details. I think that DC are doing something unique in their own way and voice, while Marvel also do the similar in their own voice and way, and that's great and awesome for all fans. 3D NOT extended version. I also feel that the they dropped the ball on Doomsday. Disabling it will result in some disabled or missing features. Slow build up to action, Wonder Woman steals the show! The purpose of this post is to break down what the Ultimate Edition improves upon, and the potential drawbacks, as well as who is likely to enjoy this full 182 minute version. It's worth noting this version isn't just Batman V Superman with deleted scenes added back in, it's the version that Snyder would have released - if a three-hour cut of the film wouldn't have been a turnoff for the average moviegoer.  <br>The Ultimate Edition is not going to make converts out of viewers who thought the "Martha" moment was an idiotic resolution to the title fight or rolled their eyes at Lois Lane's disposal (then retrieval) of a kryptonite spear. A quick check of the discs reveals that the extended version is in 2D on the third disc. Similarly, even though the movie includes a few more light-hearted moments (especially from Perry White and Alfred) as well as more background to justify the dour tone and explain why the characters are so joyless at times, the Ultimate Edition doesn't fundamentally change how the characters are portrayed or how Snyder approached this story.

Readers be warned.] Gal Gadot is a revelation as Wonder Woman. If you purchase this film, you’re probably hoping to see these two titular heroes fight, as denoted by the ‘v’ between Batman and Superman’s names. It follows Man of Steel as the second installment in the DC Extended Universe, and was by far the most anticipated movie of 2016. A one-stop shop for all things video games. The most insightful comments on all subjects will be published daily in dedicated articles. But the plot is stupid and gets stupider. <br> <br>That shouldn’t require too much set-up - especially when you consider that, within the first 10 minutes, Bruce Wayne already has a reason to fight Superman thanks to a city being demolished in a scene eerily reminiscent of the twin towers bombings. <br> <br>So rejoice: It is a good day. Try again. Unpacking Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a somewhat complicated task. So what if the Martha payoff remains iffy and Jesse Eisenberg’s Lex Luthor remains, persistently annoying. The movie began earning descriptors like “grim” and “dour,” so coupling that with a 151-minute runtime left me with the decision to pass on Batman v Superman during its theatrical run. As much as i really enjoyed the theatrical cut ( saw it twice in the cinema ), the Ultimate Cut is vastly superior. Hopefully, when time comes I'll sit down and marathon watch all of these movies in one weekend, I'll look forward to doing so. Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2016. He wanted to make a grand Superman movie, a movie about the character he loves, told with real-world consequence, gravitas and mythic stakes. It will touch on the differences between the theatrical edition and the Ultimate Edition, but not spoil them. Oh, and Doomsday gets the Venom Spider Man 3 treatment and is crammed in at the end with very little role to play other than a drawn out, poorly shot, strangely lit action sequence. The characters depicted in the film were named Bruce Wayne/Batman, Superman/Clark Kent and (ugh) Lex Luthor. A more intricate depiction of Lex's plan also feeds previously undercooked arcs for Lois and Clark, as well as Junior Senator June Finch, Alfred, and Bruce Wayne.
