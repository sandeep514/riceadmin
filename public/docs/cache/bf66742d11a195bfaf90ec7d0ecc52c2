The English have New Zealand in their sights as they bid to climb above the All Blacks in the rankings and become the world's best side, but should Jones steer England to a second World Cup crown in three years time he won't consider extending his deal with the RFU. After beating Ireland 30-9 on the final day of the Six Nations to finish second two weeks’ earlier, the RFU confirm interim coach Lancaster as the permanent head coach through to the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The bang-on-the-table, lead-with-emotion style is valuable at times, but it’s more working together. EJ: I’ve had to evolve. Eddie Jones on his coaching methods. RW: Breaks in play – setting up scrums, lineouts and so on – seem even more noticeable in games without fans. Lancaster heads into the final autumn international against Australia knowing victory is a must following defeats to New Zealand and South Africa by a combined total of six points. In all of history, as a young coach coming through you think you know everything, but the longer you coach the more you know you don’t know. Lancaster’s reign gets off to a successful, albeit slow start at Murrayfield as England defeat Scotland 13-6 in their Six Nations opener, with Charlie Hodgson scoring a crucial try while Chris Robshaw captains his country for the first time. He previously coached at Western Province and Stormers in South Africa and Kobelco Steelers in Japan. Jones believes that sport isn't all about winning - a good coach must find the balance between focusing on team organisation in an effort to win and individual skill development. Eddie Jones named new England head coach on four-year deal He wouldn’t last that long though, as a run of seven straight defeats in 2005 saw him sacked at the end of the year. EJ: It’s Astroball actually. RW: What has been your biggest learning in all your years as a coach? England lose a Six Nations decider to Wales 30-3 in a humiliating defeat in Cardiff that not only sees the Grand Slam go begging but also the championship on points difference. After consecutive defeats to South Africa, England manage to draw the third and final Test 14-14 in Port Elizabeth, with Danny Care scoring a try and Toby Flood and Owen Farrell contributing nine points. How and why are you doing that? Matt Proudfoot has had an outstanding coaching career to date culminating in being a World Cup winning coach with South Africa. We need almost an abridged version of Test rugby that’s faster and quicker, like the IPL in cricket. This time around Jones was able to persuade a wealth of talent to follow him with the likes of Australian flanker George Smith and South African duo Fourie du Preez and Danie Rossouw joining the club. EJ: Referees, and I mean that in a positive way. It is emotionally draining. You’d still have scrums and lineouts and rucks, and there would be more space. Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium. Follow Rugby World on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. It allows our most engaged readers to debate the big issues, share their own experiences, discuss real-world solutions, and more. I look to see how they react to situations, how they relate to other players, what they do off the ball. Our journalists will try to respond by joining the threads when they can to create a true meeting of independent Premium. We need serious domestic competitions and we need Test rugby, but look at Twenty20 cricket… It’s brought a new crowd in, it’s brought new skills to players, it’s brought excitement. When the team is doing it tough, that’s what you need. With any book, you can pick something out to make a headline and from what Dylan said 90% of it is positive. His side inflicted a sensational win over New Zealand in the semi-final and he will know more of the same is required against the Springboks. >> Try 3 issues of Rugby World magazine for just £5 in our Autumn Subscription Trial. RW: If you could change one law, what would it be? The world is changing and you’ve got to change with it. As a player, Jones featured heavily for prominent Sydney Premier-grade side Randwick, playing alongside current Wallabies coach Michael Cheika and former Australian coach Ewen McKenzie. Please continue to respect all commenters and create constructive debates. That’s a great book if you haven’t read it. England face the Barbarians at Twickenham on 25 October before their final Six Nations fixture against Italy on Saturday 31 October and then they will compete in the Autumn Nations Cup in November. That’s a good reinforcement of something you need and getting that emotional attachment. Eddie Jones has an illustrious career at the top of international rugby, but has never led a team to World Cup glory before. RW: So have you mellowed? Watching Test cricket, I’ve noticed how skilful players are, it’s (Twenty20) changed the way they play now. EJ: The law I’d experiment with is that the only player in the defensive side who is allowed to use their hands (at the breakdown) is the tackler. It may sound repetitive but you have to work on those skills.". RW: Are coaches or referees the biggest obstacle to quick rugby in the Premiership? You see the value he adds to the team; it shows the importance of foreign players in the competition. The 47 year-old former prop was part of Rassie Erasmus’ backroom staff during the recent Rugby World Cup. With the success at the Brumbies, the international game came calling and in 2001 he took over the Australian side. This also includes when he was with Japan, where even after their triumphant 34-32 win over South Africa the language he chose to speak to the Japanese public was in English. RW: Premiership DoRs have been positive about improved communication with you recently. ", I was pregnant with surrogate twins – then the parents pulled out, Gemma Collins looks slimmer than ever after getting 'permanent contour' on her face, Cops bust lockdown mass orgy in holiday flat as dozens show for X-rated event, Philip Schofield puffs on cigarette during night out with pals, Phil Collins's wife dumped him with ‘I’ve found someone else’ text, ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. EJ: Jimmy Gopperth. Every cycle you have the same. When you’re going well, you don’t mine deep enough. Jones was born on 30 January in 1960, so is 56. Scott Wisemantel and I coached Japan for two years by ourselves so we can cope with anything. RW: Who are the best young players in the Premiership? He earned rave reviews for getting the best out of his Australia team in 2003, beating the All Blacks before being pipped by England in the final.

RW: How easy is it to change your mind on a subject? EJ: There’s a few. Or are you planning to rely on Ben Youngs until 2023? What I’d like to see is for rugby to create something like Twenty20 cricket, something in between Test rugby and serious domestic rugby. RW: Is it important to you to empower players like that? I’m always looking at ways to improve. After starting his career at Japan as the assistant coach he began to make a name for himself with the Brumbies where he coached them to their first title in 2001. We’ll have five days to prepare for the Italy game (in October) and that means two hours on the field. Former Australia and Japan boss Eddie Jones has been unveiled as the new England head coach after signing a four-year contract to replace Stuart Lancaster. I generally try to take care of myself better. Every generation has it much easier than the last. RW: Do you have any fears for the wider community game? Taking the helm in 1994, it wasn't long before Jones used his Japanese heritage to take him into Asia, where he worked as assistant coach to Japan's national team and head coach of Suntory Sungoliath in 1996/97. That’s the great thing. But if I went back to Japan now, having seen how it’s changed, I don’t think it would be appropriate. However, the 2003 Rugby World Cup on home soil ultimately ended in failure as Australia suffered a nail-biting extra-time defeat by England in the final, although Jones was rewarded for the run to the final with a new contract through to the end of the next World Cup in 2007. EJ: Not at all. Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium. The man from Tasmania is one of the most experienced in the game and has coached in the four continents of Africa, Oceania, Europe and Asia. The RFU announce that Lancaster has resigned as England manager by mutual consent. &nbs… Start your Independent Premium subscription today. He makes 15 tackles, that’s another 45 seconds. Whatever works we’ll keep and other areas we’ll improve. RW: How do you know which approach to use with different players or different teams?
