Both used a few of Frank Frazetta art. Desk Graffiti , Girls Panties and All. Goat’s Head Soup – The Rolling Stones, cd packaging is a different size as well. Fish Out of Water – Chris Squire Nothing to much iconic about that selection, where is Symarips  Skinhead Moonstomp cover, now that itself  is well known for all old BootBoys old and new, Budgie – Squawk I totally Agree with the one that Requested “Crime Of The Century” rather than “Breakfast In America” of Supertramp’s Covers. And although they had other great album covers,I will submit Quicksilver Messenger Service and “Happy Trails”. Iron Maiden – Number Of the Beast </p> <p>Deep Purple’s “In Rock” Mount Rushmore- Cover’s Truly Is a Unique Record Cover and on of Rock and Roll’s most Famous ones. </p> <p>Do you eat, drink, and live the written word? – Pretty much anything created by Hipgnosis, including 10cc Deceptive Bends ver but fake! Supposedly banged out in a single evening, its use of bright, primary colors was startling at the time, hinting at the hallucinogenic nightmare within, and the use of a cog for an eye punned on the title, referenced the iconic film, and conveyed the sense of society being broken all at once. Sly & The Family Stone’s “There’s a Riot Going On” (Even though My copy is the one with Title printed on the front.) ELP – Tarkus. </p> <p>                                        | $15.95. Oh, I forgot to note that all covers done by Neon Park for all Little Feat albums. Blown Pig,pigs head,headphones,sunglasses,a smoke,hilarious. They had some of the best album cover art </p> <p>Thin Lizzy: Jailbreak And not just because she is nude!!! Wendy Waldman – Strange Company As art and not the music inside, Beatles White Album and AC DC’s Back In Black can go and put these two in. Eric Clapton – 461 Ocean Blvd The Doors  ” Full Circle ”  (great cover, crappy album. Now 91 years old, the graphic artist is credited with creating the "Big Book Look," a style that includes a "large, bold title, prominent author's name, small conceptual image." Served its purpose no doubt in keeping a hungover intern busy for an afternoon copying and pasting images and not otherwise effing up an important (sic) project. With all four bandmembers together in a bathtub, the cover said more about The Mamas & The Papas than what was probably intended. The cover image of bassist Paul Simonon smashing his instrument practically screams rock’n’roll, just like the music inside. Maybe it’s not a rock album but it’s certainly one of the most iconic covers of all. Arriving one year after his milestone album The Payback, Brown delivered the double-album Hell, which called out societal ills both on record and on the elaborately illustrated cover.                                 $14.49 What is it wit all the Beatles albums???? </p> <p>Lists like this are always subjective! This is the first time I’ve heard somebody besides myself mention Crawler or Back Street Crawler in any way . Thinking of going digital? Signed, An OLD rocker, Todd Rundgren – Something/Anything? Neil Young – Harvest or After the Goldrush Famous book covers with stories of their own. The cover for The Miracles’ 1961 debut encapsulates the old-school showbiz that Motown would soon lead the world away from. Freewheel By Bob Dylan </p> <p>Nobody ever slung a jacket over their shoulder that well. Paperback But also the more “Adult” Art-Photo and Graphics Covers of the ECM- Label had som great Covers in the 70s and 80s. A good cover became a great one the moment when a bored Johnny Ramone decided to give the photographer the finger. I would suggest Vangelis – Heaven and Hell , Manfred Mann – Angle Station , and Alan Parsons Project – I Robot. </p> <p>                                        | $13.95. You could also see Yeezus as the last celebration of the physical CD before it disappeared. BTO’s “Not Fragile” Would be nice to actually officially credit them too! It sort of makes me ” Stone Cold Sober “, So good to hear of Crawler again. The Silver Mt. arc of a diver? An iconic cover – and album …. The Doors – Morrison Hotel Juicy Lucy? You included the original/European cover Jimi Hendrix’ Electric Ladyland, which Hendrix hated. The covers are great but I prefer the ones with the best music. The Led Zeppelin “III” cover is a far more Original and Iconic Cover even though “HOTH” is one of Hipgnosis’ most beautiful designs. Those who have chosen the list looked at books, as the themselves state. – The B-52s first two albums BOTH ARE DIAMOND CERTIFIED ALBUMS AND WERE MADE BY THE BEST AMERICAN HARD ROCK BAND IN HISTORY!! Most people don’t even notice the details of this cover at first. I like the list, but my personal Favourite covers include Kevin Coyne, ‘millionaires and teddy bears’, Ian Dury, ‘new boots and panties’, jungle brothers, ‘done by the forces of nature’, Julian cope, ‘dark orgasm’, beck, ‘morning phase’, Peaches, ‘fatherfucker’,  van Morrison, ‘astral weeks’ and the john Lee Hooker and canned heat collaboration. Come on no one has even said Goats Head Soup! Interesting! Hope to see him when he comes to the US and Canada next month and in Dec, too. Any of the First 3 Waterboys album covers. </p> <p>What the heck are the Beatles covers doing in this list? There are a couple of Yes albums too that I can think of also. Paul Simon – Graceland Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley Robin Trower’s BRIDGE OF SIGH’S, Come on people ? Or Cindy Lauper’s “Shes So Unusual”? Rick Griffin artwork ! Most of these album covers ain`t that great. TOUGH CHOICES! </p> <p>Graphic designer and art director Jean-Paul Goude met his match, and his muse, with Grace Jones. Kate Bush – The Dreaming (with a kiss, I’d pass they key) The B&N Podcast: Mike Birbiglia and J. excelent   …………Which one si the most important sleeve of all times?? Leonardo DiCaprio's slick Jay Gatsby took center stage. A Million Little Pieces, by James Frey Maybe even Synchronicity or Zenyette Mondetta.            Here’s proof: https://youtu.be/QARxQsSJo58. Photo was actually taken on the 20th. 1. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey. I think it would be better to have 1 cover per artist on the list because there are so many great ones. Fool, You wish you were ignorant enough to have $450 billion dollars. (Suddenly I’m in doubt; Is it actually there?). Sigur Ros all. Do you remember the characters, the authors, the quotes, and the plot lines as well as you think you do? "And there was that train!". East of Eden. Bridge of Sighs – Robin Trower I am happy Ogden’s Nut Gone Flake is presented. Not so much the cover of the edition featured here, which is quite nice, but this one, designed by David Pelham in 1972 to coincide with the film release. Ultra-cool Elvis (in his shiny gold Nudie suit) gets multiplied in one of the most enduring early 60s images and greatest album covers. </p> <p></p> <p>This Reagan-era concept album makes its visual point by using a photo of Beatles records being burned that followed John Lennon’s “more popular than Jesus” remarks. This style of art would be associated with psychedelic music from here on out, though Crumb was a bit anti-hippie himself. The stark lines converging on the diffuse, cloud-like title creates a head-ache inducing optical illusion.                                 $15.95. Ten Years After “SSSSH, “Stonehenge”, and Cricklewood Green” C’mon Iron Maiden: Killers and KISS: Rock and Roll Over are the greatest cover arts of all time! </p> <p>Whatever. Metallica’s trademark mix of shock value and social commentary had few better expressions than this image of a modern take on Lady Justice for their 1988 album …And Justice For All. Really?            Scorpions…Blackout, Rainbow : Rising born to run? Ten points if you got the original with the underwear inner sleeve. Thin Lizzy – Black Rose There were so many great covers that could replace all of these, in my opinion! Read some good books about them. Mike Oldfield Tubular Bells. </p> <p>Edgar Froese: Macula Transfer nice version of the ramones :))))) What about ‘It’s only a Movie’, with the free Banger inside?! The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald May this cover never to retired. The Who – “The Who Sell Out” Depeche Mode – Violator Violent Femmes “Hallowed Ground” is another. The Stone Roses – The Stone Roses Genesis: Seconds Out Ian Dury – New Boots and Panties  (how the hell did you miss this ?) Rate 5 stars Rate 4 stars Rate 3 stars Rate 2 stars Rate 1 star . Where is the magnificant album of Blind Faith. Most of Pink Floyd’s covers would be in the running for a list of the greatest album covers, but this burst of Hipgnosis imagination featuring four versions of the same photo (except that the band rotates one position in each) matched their sense of surrealism. or endless summer, their comp from 74 that put them back on top of the world! Alberto Vargas was already the most famous pin-up artist before designing the cover for The Cars classic 1979 album Candy-O, but this painting of a stylish redhead, on a car of course, became his most famous piece.  No “LIVE” cover for GFR? This Mugnaini chap, whoever he was, had to be found, met, known." Ballantine Books agreed that the original edition of Fahrenheit 451 was something special. Paul Bacon has designed an entire library's worth of book covers: 6,500, give or take a few. Steely Dan – “The Royal Scam”. why on earth is Ian Dury & The Blockheads ‘Do It Yourself’ not on that list and covers like Madness and Elvis Costello are? Many good picks here and I was happy to see perhaps my favorite album ever,The new riders “the adventures of Panama red, although I,m not sure if it deserved it. Disturbed has some rather good album covers (e.g. What Ho! Carly Simon – Really, all of them, but Playing Possum is a classic! Black Moses by Isaac Hayes!            Not so fast! </p> <p>Kiss: Destroyer Some Ramones’ fans will get very angry! Smashing Pumpkins’ album covers were often softer and prettier than the music, but this cover (created by Billy Corgan’s then-girlfriend) is the perfect translation of the obsessively romantic theme of Adore. The best Electric Ladyland cover was the one with all the nude girls on it…..I still have my copy of it, they were on the front and back of the album. ELOs “Out of the Blue” Luckily, no one seems to have cared what he thought. Of course, this a personal preference. The one for Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player was just right, drawing from his soon-to-be-legendary love of movies. This cover did wonders with its simple strategy. “Sweet Moments With The Blue Velvet Band”  for the Eric Von Schmidt designed board game on the  INSIDE of the fold out cover. Golden Earring – Moontan I chose LP’s from musicians that  I liked – that were done by fine artists of note and were interesting to look at. Thin Lizzy – Live and Dangerous We know now who the real fool really is…. I ended up with Sticky Fingers – Warhol, Weasel’s Ripped MF – Neon Parks, Disreali Gears – Martin Sharp etc. This iconic album cover said it all about coy mid-60s sexuality, bachelor-pad style. Agree that there are many Grateful Dead album covers that are better than those in the list. Frank Zappa wrapped his skewering of hippie culture We’re Only In It for the Money in an equally vicious parody of the Sgt.
