The world's defining voice in music and pop culture since 1952. Formed in 2001, The Killers exploded into the mainstream with the release of debut album Hot Fuss. It remains one of the most impressive debuts of modern times. Perfect for watching the sun set behind a festival stage, ‘Read My Mind’ is a dizzying cocktail of euphoria and melancholy that Flowers and co. brew up so well.

Alongside Brandon Flowers’ Springsteen-esque vocal melodies, The Killers cultivated a distinct sound out of synths and guitars. —Juan Gutierrez, “Read My Mind” offers up some of the best lyricism in The Killers’ repertoire: “A teenage queen / A loaded gun / A drop-dead dream / The chosen one.” It’s as nostalgic as it is painful, tied together by the contained power of Flowers’ vocals—not too harsh, not too quiet, just the right pacing. Even if you don’t consider yourself a big fan you can’t deny that they have some incredibly catchy songs. Brightside” serves as the anger and initial reaction to pain, while “Miss Atomic Bomb” is what comes after it simmers,  leaving listeners alone with the memories.

Brightside,” made for crying after your karaoke session ends… Well, actually there is one: “Miss Atomic Bomb” from 2012’s Battle Born. “Caution” has hardly been out long enough to make an impression, but it closes with a stunning solo from Fleetwood Mac’s Lindsey Buckingham—enough said.

View The Killers song lyrics by popularity along with songs featured in, albums, videos and … It’s a song that deals with life’s suffering and lack of meaning, while featuring the band’s most oblique line, “I got soul, but I’m not a soldier.” Plus, the song ends with the climactic gospel build-up with vocals from the Sweet Inspirations, a R&B group founded by Whitney Houston’s mother. —Lexi Lane, The opener to their debut album, “Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine” serves as an extension of Flowers’ inspirations: Morrissey and a real-life murder case.

So ließen sie sich schon bei ihrer ersten Single Mr. Brightside von dieser Band inspirieren. It’s edgy. There are no frills or synths here—it just gets right to the heart of Flowers’ talent. We swear the second verse goes just a little bit harder than the rest, though. ‘Run For Cover’ is a relentless rock’n’roll shotgun blast that hits its target no matter where it’s aimed.
