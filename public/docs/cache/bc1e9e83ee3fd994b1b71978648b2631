Beyonc√© and Shahadi Wright Joseph voice the character in the 2019 CGI live adaptation of the original film directed by Jon Favreau. Simba invites Nala to visit the forbidden Elephant Graveyard with him, despite his father Mufasa's orders. "[28] However, as strong as she is, Nala has little impact elsewhere;[28] author Brian K. Pennington wrote in his book Teaching Religion and Violence that "Nala's assertions of gender equality are clearly groundless, since only a male lion can stop Scar. Getty Anthony Davis #3 of the Los Angeles Lakers reacts with his daughter Nala after winning the 2020 NBA Championship over the Miami Heat in Game Six of the 2020 NBA Finals. [15], The film's entire recording process took approximately three years to complete, during which Kelly's sessions were held in both the United States and Canada, while her co-stars Broderick and Jeremy Irons, voice of Scar, were recording in the United States and England, respectively. [56] Favreau felt that "part of [her joining the film] is that she‚Äôs got young kids, part of it is that it‚Äôs a story that feels good for this phase of her life and her career, and she really likes the original very much. [47] Unlike Ophelia, Nala does not succumb to insanity, nor does she eventually die. [40] Stephens believes that Nala and Simba's separation allows the characters to fall in love "properly" upon reuniting as young adults. Nala observes that Kiara, of whom Simba is very protective, has inherited her father's rebellious personality and love of adventure. Simba eventually defeats Scar and becomes king, with Nala ultimately becoming his queen. </p> <p>Nala Davis is on Facebook. However, the character has garnered positive reviews as well. [14][51], Voiced by actress Gabrielle Union,[52] Nala reprises her role as Queen of the Pride Lands in the television series The Lion Guard, the 2016 premiere of which was preceded by the made-for-television film The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar (2015). </p> <p>Her Broadway debut,[61] at first auditioning for the role proved a challenge for the singer due to her Ragtime contract, which her agent was eventually successful in getting her released from.

Nala is a lioness animated character appearing in Disney's The Lion King franchise.Introduced in the animated film The Lion King in 1994, Nala subsequently appears as a less prominent character in the film's sequels The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) and The Lion King 1¬Ω (2004), and serves as a recurring character in The Lion Guard (2015‚Äì2019). </p> <p>[71] PopSugar ranked Kelly among the website's "Favorite Animated Voices", writing, "there are a lot of great voices in Disney's The Lion King ... but Moira Kelly has a unique quality to her voice, and I remember reveling in it as a youngster anytime the adult Nala was on the screen. [13] Vocally, Kelly decided to approach the role as though she were reading to a child, explaining, "it's kind of fun to play with different voices and try to color the lines for the child so they can imagine it more fully", which she admitted is different than how the actress would approach a live-action role. She is also an instructor for the Paralegal Studies Program, which is offered through the Office of Continuing and Professional Education at Virginia Commonwealth University. With both Simba and Mufasa dead, Scar usurps the throne and becomes king. </p> <p>As the film was inspired by William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, Nala is considered to be The Lion King's equivalent of Hamlet's love interest Ophelia, although differences remain between the two characters. </p> <p>She reunites with Simba at the jungle like in the original but leaves immediately after Simba refuses to return, only for Simba to follow her soon after changing his mind. [57] The film marks the comeback of the singer since her pregnancy and her first musical film since  Dreamgirls in 2006. Writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe hailed Kelly's voice acting as "terrific. [57] Joseph said that, upon learning that Beyonc√© would be voicing the grown-up Nala, she "really had to step [her] game up and think about what Beyonc√© would want". [citation needed]. [26][28][64] James Berardinelli of ReelViews appreciated the fact that "after three animated motion pictures centered upon the love of two people from different worlds", the love story between Nala and Simba has been relegated to that of "a subplot. Upon learning that Simba has eventually decided to return to Pride Rock and face Scar, Nala travels back to the Pride Lands to assist him. [8] Candice Russel of the Sun-Sentinel believes that Nala contributes to the film's love story ‚Äì "an indispensable factor in Disney cartoon features" ‚Äì in addition to convincing Simba to return to Pride Rock. </p> <p>Before joining Allen & Allen, Ashley represented defendants and insurance companies in Ashley is a sought-after public speaker and has given lectures on a variety of litigation topics including corporate depositions, legal ethics, federal procedure, legal research and writing, products liability, e-discovery, and effective techniques for handling out-of-state litigation. [57][58] The same day Shahadi Wright Joseph was cast as young Nala in the film. "[1] In early versions of the screenplay, Nala has a younger brother named Mheetu, who enjoys accompanying her and her best friend Simba on their adventures. </p> <p>And then, of course, there are these wonderful musical numbers that she can be involved with, and my God‚Ä¶ she really lives up to her reputation as far as the beauty of her voice and talent". </p> <p>–ü—Ä–∏—Å—ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ—Ç–µ —Å–µ –∫—ä–º Facebook, –∑–∞ –¥–∞ —Å–µ —Å–≤—ä—Ä–∂–µ—Ç–µ —Å Nala Davis –∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏, –∫–æ–∏—Ç–æ –º–æ–∂–µ –¥–∞ –ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–≤–∞—Ç–µ. When Kiara befriends Zira's son Kovu, a young lion from an exiled pride of Scar's followers known as the Outsiders, Nala is much more tolerant of their relationship than Simba, and convinces him to offer Kovu a chance to prove himself trustworthy. [44] Both characters' relationships with and opinions of their love interests are similar,[45] however, there are several differences between the two women.

"[11], The speaking voice of adult Nala is provided by American actress Moira Kelly. Surprised to find Simba alive, Scar forces his guilt-ridden nephew to "admit" to the pride that he is responsible for Mufasa's death, which was in fact caused by Scar himself by throwing Mufasa off a cliff into the stampede. [2] Simba was intended to save the cub from a wildebeest stampede,[3] and Nala would eventually become responsible for protecting Mheetu from Simba's tyrannical uncle Scar. [13] Kelly would not officially be offered the part until several months after her audition; Disney's first choice for the role remains undisclosed.

According to Johnson Cheu, author of Diversity in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability, the fact that Mufasa, Scar, and Simba appear to be the only male lions present in The Lion King suggests the possibility that either Mufasa or Scar is Nala's father, which would in turn make Nala either Simba's half-sister or cousin. </p> <p>[28] Writing for the University of Waterloo's Kinema, Vicky Wong believes that Nala reinforces the film's "take your place" motif, reminding main character Simba of his responsibilities.
