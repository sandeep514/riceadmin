This began an enduring relationship, based on a shared commitment to changing the world and an understanding that those most abused by this predatory, ruthless capitalist system would lead. My impression of his flat is at odds with the stigma attached to Waterloo’s social housing towers. Honduran workers are fighting for independence, freedom, employment, and social rights! His computer, TV recorder and telephone were in action at all hours. Hundreds of photos, Ray’s political memorabilia, including well-worn T-shirts, and special treasures such at the Human Rights Award presented by the French government in 2013, lifted the room. Ray tolerated being called Uncle Ray and, to those who bothered to enquire about his preference, his response was always, “call me Comrade.” His persistent message was of solidarity, based on a shared struggle against the divide-and-conquer profit system. The final workshop was a teach-in about Aboriginal deaths in custody, presented by co-sponsor the Indigenous Social Justice Association–Melbourne. Jug Agius was one of them. A Darumbul woman from central Queensland, Amy McQuire is the former editor of the National Indigenous Times and Tracker magazine. Ray was the president of the Indigenous Social Justice Association. But Bassi could not imagine what it would take to be Ray’s ‘brain’, he told us, and he could ‘never be’ Ray’s heart. It was held in Melbourne, in early December. It will enhance any encyclopedic page you visit with the magic of the WIKI 2 technology. <br> <br>However, it was Aboriginal Deaths in Custody that took up most of his time. Following a long time of worsening health, he was hospitalised for pneumonia, then returned home and died in his sleep. Indict killer cops. Ray’s signature cap — covered with badges solidarising with Palestinians, refugees, the LGBTIQ community and demanding sovereignty for First Nations people — was the centrepiece. The interview took place at Ray's home in Waterloo, 14 October 2008. The prison’s use of a head restraint called a “spit hood,” was clearly a factor in Wayne’s death by asphyxia. <br> <br>He was as keen as ever to continue the fight for his people and all those oppressed. He concluded, “Ray has received insufficient recognition for his selflessness and service.”, Debbie Brennan spoke for co-sponsors, Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women: “Ray was a stolen child, who never reconnected with his mother and siblings whom he was separated from at two years old.  <br>His flat was stuffed with floor-to-ceiling documents, journals, DVDs and books—all meticulously arranged. I use WIKI 2 every day and almost forgot how the original Wikipedia looks like. But is the Democratic Party the solution? <br> <br>Ray organised passport ceremonies welcoming refugees to Aboriginal Australia. The source code for the WIKI 2 extension is being checked by specialists of the Mozilla Foundation, Google, and Apple. Despite his and many other activists' efforts, little has improved in Australia since a Royal Commission was held in 1991 looking at Indigenous deaths in custody. Ray Jackson, President and founder of the Indigenous Social Justice Association (ISJA) Sydney was a tireless campaigner for Aboriginal Australia, particularly active in fighting against black deaths in custody. He spoke on Oxford Street in 2013 at a protest against the police brutality towards that year’s Mardi Gras revelers. For 11 years, Ray and ISJA supported the family, never letting up on exposing the truth and bringing the cops to justice. This was after a decade’s work for the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Watch Committee. Inspired by Ray’s movement building, a snap action was called for the next day — International Human Rights Day — in the heart of Melbourne. "[5], However, when the government led by Prime Minister John Howard cut all funding to the committee, Jackson established the Indigenous Social Justice Association (ISJA) to continue the work. Definitely an old school activist, Ray devoted decades to the campaign to Stop Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Our solidarity goes out to Ray’s children, Aaron, Biame, Carolyne, Francine, John and Kath, to his granddaughters, Rebecca, Kristine, Tara, Madeka and Oakie and his great granddaughters Sienna and Amira. In a recent article, Ray told the story of his early life, When someone great is gone: remembering Ania Walwicz, Standing against transphobia and for the right to protest. We have to speak with one voice and strike with one fist.”. Vibrant union banners beautifully complemented the multi-poster display. View latest articles, news and information about what happened to Ray Jackson, Australian aboriginal activist and Wiradjuri elder, that died on Thursday April 23rd 2015at age 74. The walls were covered with photos of his children and grandchildren, his granddaughter’s early drawings, other artworks and the Aboriginal flag. <br> <br>Unionism, feminism and socialism plus Ray’s fierce commitment to what he called Koori Justice and to international revolution carved out his being. <br> <br>Cycle Re-cycle accepts donations of old and broken bikes and then put the bits and pieces together. He was a regular face at protests against black deaths in custody, attending in his characteristic black hat and bag adorned with social justice pins. Like these giants, Ray led by example, dedicating his life to fighting oppression in its many forms. And he recognised the thief: a system that profits from plunder. So he was stamped with the word ‘Stolen,’ many times over. [3] He campaigned for justice for the families of victims, Eddie Murray, Mark Mason and TJ Hickey.[4]. He was pretty hard to miss as he always wore a hat covered in political badges – often with a matching vest. You reached into so many lives, I’m grateful mine was one of them. The name Micah M. White kept coming up in articles and twitter searches – so we sent off a bunch of emails trying to…, When Radio Skid Row reporter, Em Couch went to interview Cathy Nisbit from Kogarah Community Services about her work, Cathy wasn't sure if she considered herself an activist.
