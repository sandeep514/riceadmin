In a career that scaled the heights of 61 Scotland caps and selection for the British and Irish Lions, Doddie Weir won plenty of battles. "You could see him welling up, that's when it hit me. Doddie will have reached the two-year mark in December since his diagnosis and is determined to maximise every moment. His wife Kathy recalled the exact moment that changed their lives forever. ", READ MORE: Doddie Weir reveals he was hospitalised after 'puncturing lung'​. The former rugby player said he was "very fortunate" to be able to see the work being done behind the scenes by scientists studying the condition, but feels that more investment is needed to deliver a breakthrough. "I've been thinking about it for 20 years and with my recent diagnosis - I'm not sure how long I've got left - that compelled me to put pen to paper and put my very enjoyable life together to show my story," he says. Doddie says he and Kathy are closer now because she has to do more for him - which now includes shaving. "So people who are diagnosed with MND have a chance because there is an option, because at the moment there's no option. Doddie Weir: It was the good old days of Melrose v Gala. Last updated on 30 October 201830 October 2018.From the section Scottish Rugbycomments102. It's given me a smile on my face when I wake up and it's just shown me how lucky I've been.

Doddie Weir Liam Sutcliffe pays tribute to Rob Burrow ahead of Leeds Rhinos Wembley outing Rob Burrow has Motor Neurone Disease, a diagnosis which rocked the Yorkshire club. Doddie's doctor told him he would be in a wheelchair within a year. "Certainly fighting MND is like that as well, there's no point in getting down. "Dressing is hard work. The former Scotland international has hit out over the lack of progress in finding a cure and has called on the NHS to invest more resources in research. Joost died in early 2017, not long after Doddie's own diagnosis. A room will be converted into my bedroom. Amy Irons, from BBC Scotland's The Nine, takes on former Scotland defender Steven Pressley in this week's Sportscene Predictions. One of the best. Everything you need to know about following football with BBC Sport Scotland. We've got to keep partying and living and enjoying our lives.". "When we were sat in that doctor's office and he said, 'You have MND' it was a big blow to me. After 13 years of dominance, Glasgow City are facing the biggest threat yet to their reign at the top of Scottish women's football. Doddie says he doesn't regret letting the camera into his family's lives. Back in 2016, Doddie's son Hamish had spotted the signs that something was wrong before he knew his dad was sick. We're in a bit of trouble. A terrible disease being being borne with dignity. "I am one of the lucky ones - two-and-a-half years in and I am still here.". ", He tells John: "The setting of goals now is smaller - getting up the stairs or getting out to check the cows. One of those memories came in November when Doddie and his teenage sons Hamish, 18, Angus, 17, and Ben, 15 , delivered the match day ball before Scotland's match with New Zealand at Murrayfield. ", He added: "So there is no platform or pathway that helps. And getting to the weekend to watch the boys' rugby.". Doddie also wrote his autobiography, My Name'5 Doddie - a reference to his number five shirt number -  and said one of the reasons was to let his sons know what he got up to on the tours with the Lions. But I think that was the point when it hit dad. "There's not even any pathways. At this point, the MND was mainly affecting Doddie's hands, making everyday tasks like fastening a button difficult. Every patient has to look at their self cure.". "From the day we were told I had MND there's been nothing on the table that people with MND can get hold of. Doddie's engagements were cut back and he gave up his day-to-day work. "With the foundation and team and support behind us, it has just been unbelievable. So choked up when I saw him and his kids bring the match ball on to Murrayfield in November,  all the best Doddie. Doddie has also reconsidered his view on rugby's part in his disease. "The reason for doing this is to try to explain the frustrations," he said. "It's going to be amazing. The former Melrose, Newcastle and Scotland lock is speaking at the launch of his new autobiography, a project he says has been long in the pipeline but hastened by his changing circumstances. "They say these sort of collisions could have an effect on the brain," he said. However, June 2019 brought devastating news to the Weir family. All the very best Doddie. Sportscene will show all of the day's Scottish Premiership goals every Saturday evening this season. "With any luck, I've got a year, a year plus, to enjoy this," Weir says. The start of 2019 was accompanied by building work at the Weirs' home in the Borders. Doddie had taken him for "one of their chats", a walk around the family farm in the Borders. He now says that, with hindsight, there could have been "some sort of incidental connection". He is emotional talking about family. "I think being active has helped me to be where I am and not have as many symptoms as what I could have. So for example - swimming, does it help? I felt bloody horrendous the next day but I can still use my legs, still talk, still eat – so I’m lucky. Scottish Rugby was almost left with a bill for a new stadium roof such was the thunderous reception afforded by the Scotland fans for arguably their favourite son. That's unacceptable. Over time the muscles weaken and stop working, inhibiting the ability to walk, talk, eat or drink unaided.

Other people it starts with their voice, their eating, their legs. It's horrific what happens to people with MND so the care is there but the cure is not. But I am still here, still living life and still continuing. As Scottish lower league football returns this weekend, why not test your knowledge by trying to name all 30 clubs in Scotland's bottom three divisions? MND is a complex condition which affects people differently and progresses at different rates. In November, Murrayfield witnessed a powerful and memorable moment as Doddie, flanked by his sons, brought the match-ball on to the pitch ahead of Scotland's meeting with New Zealand.
