KirkusReviews - A Suitable Boy Kirkus Reviews tend to be brief, only two or three paragraphs long. <br> <br>KirkusReviews - A Suitable Boy Kirkus Reviews tend to be brief, only two or three paragraphs long. There is a lot to get through in the first episode. For even more, visit our Family Entertainment Guide. A SUITABLE BOY by Vikram Seth is the story of four families in India in the early 1950s after British occupation has ended and the India/Pakistan Partition has taken place. The emphasis is on describing the writing style and quality, with a short plot synopsis included. The story starts with a wedding, and we see Lata against the backdrop of her extended family, and witness her mixed feelings about the arranged marriage of her much-admired elder sister Savita. “When India became independent in 1947, it was partitioned into two countries,” begins Andrew Davies’s staunchly traditional adaptation, which is directed by Mira Nair and was filmed on location in north India. So, this six-episode distillation of Vikram Seth’s 1,300-page panorama of post-partition India has to do everything, at once, in multiple territories. Take the scene in which Lata argues with her English professor about why TS Eliot – “He’s American, isn’t he?” – is on the syllabus of “British Masters of the 20th Century”, but James Joyce is not. Lata, a spirited university student, is preparing for her sister’s arranged marriage as her mother warns her that she, too, “will marry a boy I choose”. <br> <br>When news of Lata's secret romance reaches her <br> <br>And Davies, who would find an elegant way in adapting the dictionary to reduce it to its dirty words, is masterly at weaving the small thread into the big picture. The novel begins with the arranged marriage of Lata's sister Savita to Pran Kapoor,a young man who is a professor in Brahmpur University and from a prominent family. But The Crown is permitted to move at a stately pace. Drama, Romance. <br> <br>The slowness of the pace, even the slowness of the camera work, reinforces all this. Though not an epic novel in the usual sense of the word, A SUITABLE BOY is certainly epic in scale, over 1,400 pages in length. Some people were not happy with the choice of Davies – who is not just a white British writer, but the white British monarch of the period adaptation – to tell this vast story of newly independent India. <br> <br>This study guide contains the following sections: This detailed literature summary also contains Topics for Discussion and a Free Quiz on Aside from Lata's heartbreaking decision not to marry Kabir, there is little real ugliness in the novel outside of inter- and intra-family intrigues which Seth somehow manages to make interesting reading.   To understand the novel, the reader must also understand to a certain extent the Indian culture of racial castes and arranged marriages. Naughty boy Maan (played by the Bollywood lead Ishaan Khatter) embarrasses his father, a high-ranking politician, by throwing the home minister into a fountain during Holi festival, then pursuing a ghazal singer, Saeeda, played by the legendary Indian actor Tabu. Just a reminder to some: this is not a 2020, Americo-European, slick, CGI-laden action film. Mrs. Rupa recognizes that boys from very wealthy families will not do because they would expect too expensive a wedding. Suddenly, everyone had a copy of A Suitable Boy, Rohinton Mistry’s A Fine Balance or Arundhati Roy’s The God of Small Things busting out of their bag. As Indian girls gain more independence like going out shopping in small groups of friends and attending university classes, there arises a conflict between many girls and their families over the idea of an arranged marriage. The production values are high, the performances poised and the locations stunning, from the dusty markets of Calcutta to the fictional university town of Brahmpur. There is a rich cast of characters, many of whom are members of Lata's extended family, and some writing of extraordinary beauty and lyricism. I revelled in the characters with all their quirkiness and idiosyncrasies, and I found them an antidote to the often-crass over-acting that is churned out today.

To further complicate the plot, Maan Kapoor, Pran's younger brother, becomes infatuated with the notorious Muslim courtesan, Saeeda Bai. It is the BBC’s first period drama – in more than half a century of forays into the past in horse and carriage, from where you get a rather restricted view of history – with an entirely south Asian cast and no white characters.

That is the power of this genre, one that my Indian family has gobbled up since my parents first fell for The Barchester Chronicles.
