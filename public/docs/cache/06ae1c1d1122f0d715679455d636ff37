The Rule of Law is ultimately, the foundation of democracy that every country should acquire for the better of their own legal systems, regardless of whether it is criminal law, civil law or public law. Meanwhile, the rule of law become more important in the discussion of human rights. To explain it precisely, the principle is that no one is above the law.
