It would be unfair to ruin the surprise, except it seems very fair to reveal that there is a surprise, since nothing in this gaudy, noisy scrapbook of a movie suggests that anything of any magnitude is coming. 							  While this isn’t initially explored, Enoch introduces his grandson to the projects denizens, including a dangerous Blood (Nate Parke), and a young girl named Chazz (Toni Lysaith), whose mother, Sister Sharon (Heather Alicia Simms) has a crush on the bishop.

Lee manages to have put together an excellent soundtrack for the film, culminating in the perfectly used “Want You to Know” by the Freelance Hellraisers at the film’s end. 							 															Interviews This nirvana doesn't last long but it proves that Lee can do it if he tries. 								 But when he decides to teach us about the human heart, it becomes a potent experience.

I still cannot fathom whatever point Lee's trying to make here, or why he would derail his not-bad summer idyll with such a nuclear bomb.

And when it does, it's a stark reminder of how good Spike Lee can be when he's on form, in films like Inside Man, The 25th Hour, Clockers, Malcolm X and, his defining work Do The Right Thing.

Sidney Poitier’s 7 Most Memorable Performances, All Harry Potter Movies Ranked Worst to Best by Tomatometer. Flick's grandfather Enoch (Clarke Peters) is a preacher from the James Brown school of subtlety, and much of the film is devoted to his impressive but somewhat irritating sermons, which intrude on the film like the return of repressed DVD extras. Flick is a spoilt suburban boy who talks "white" to the other kids in the projects, notably Chazz (Tony Lysaith), who is baffled by his mohawk and iPad 2. Clarke Peters is an impressive force, but the story gets away from Spike Lee on this one. Lee's typically paradoxical statements on race and religion muddle the narrative, and his old stylistic tricks -- saturated color schemes, characters addressing the camera -- aren't exactly inspired. The bombshell, when it finally comes, seems to be cut in from another movie, but its arrival saves the film from the dreaded one-star review. Unpolished performances are forgivable in they've got a great story to support them. By.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 58% based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 5.46/10. 							 Actors shriek to be heard above the incessant piano score, and when Bruce Hornsby isn't tinkling the ivories, any brief moment of respite is sure to be filled with a tsunami of gospel, or Judith Hill's Michael Jackson-like wall of soul. While Flik records the world around us, we see the projects from a privileged (it’s made clear that Flik is a whitewashed character) viewpoint, and perhaps the most intriguing element of the onerous two thirds of the film are how they stack up to Spike Lee’s landscape of urban youth in Do The Right Thing (1989). 								 																																			 However, the film could have benefited from a three quarters of an hour trim. 						 3.8 out of 5. With his first fictional film since 2008’s Miracle at St. Anna, the ever divisive Spike Lee returns with a film he himself personally financed,  Red Hook Summer. 						 It comes off embarrassingly amateurish at times, but other times the sentimental moments will captivate you, but only for a moment. 					  						 								By Mladen PechevskiOctober 16, 2020 						 							 Forgot your password?
