The wings have make the exact same journey as Chuck. There is nothing in the room that implies that she had dedicated a room in their house to Chuck's disappearance for the entire time. We first see them in a seemingly unrelated scene at the pretty redhead artist's ranch when she is still married to the cheater dude. Hanks had spent years developing the project with screenwriter William Broyles, Jr. before director Robert Zemeckis came aboard, beginning principal photography in January 1999.  She was the sender of the 2nd package. Pretty unsatisfactory, probably why it was cut and left a mystery. The point of the scene is that he has no idea what he's doing. Kelly is actually saying "Chuck", but apparently because she is both running and shouting it comes out "Ch-YA-uck", so that anyone within earshot named either "Chuck" or "Jack" would turn around to see who was paging them. <br> <br>Answer: Somewhere in the Great Plains, you heard the Woman's vague directions, "Whole lotta nothing 'till you get to Canada", and from the looks of things, it's not important anyway, the generic nature seems to be a plot device. And on the final, third utterance she is saying "Chuck", with no YA meme. It should be easy to make a catch basin of some sort if necessary. Think about it. Answer: I noticed this too. He is really seeing a whale. Just because she still cares for Chuck (and maybe wishes things had turned out differently), doesn't mean she doesn't love her husband or wants to leave him. (Scurvy takes just a few weeks to set in.). Bettina is a female name predominantly found in the Italian and German languages. More likely, once he disappeared, she did whatever she could to try and find him. Trivia: Screenwriter William Broyles took survival courses and during that time a Wilson brand soccer ball washed up on shore - the inspiration for Wilson in the movie. This scene shows what is coming as a whale wakes him up in time to see the ship. She has a family. That, presumably, is the package that is aboard the doomed FedEx plane Chuck is on and the one he returns to her four years later. They appear in several scenes. She has a family. <br> <br>The ranch, a bed and breakfast and museum are at 9760 County Road 5, Canadian, TX. Chuck, an experienced sailor, was obsessed with tracking time. <br> <br>Bettina Peterson: All right, then. Answer: You can use any wood (although technically bamboo is a grass and not wood), it just should be very dry wood. Very rarely have I seen a valid mistake regarding an actor calling a character the wrong name. While it is possible to make a fire by the rubbing sticks, don't you need to run the stick against bamboo for the trick to work? Also, the artist would have been on the island with him just like Kelly was in the watch. While Zemeckis has joked there was a waterproof satellite phone in it, the real answer from the script is, no joke, salsa verde. SPOILER ALERT: The descriptions below include plot points of the film. The inner shell itself is not that difficult to open. It was never shown what was in that last package. They have finally returned to the redhead and bought Chuck with them. I agree with your assessment, though the wings also serve as a more practical plot device. So this could have been the signed returned divorce papers in a new package with golden wings and not her original sent package with pink wings? Is it really that difficult to break open? You have to be gentle when you break it so all the water doesn't just go everywhere, like it would if you pounded it with say, a large rock. Only at the end did it click. He had retrieved the Bettina package years earlier from the ocean, while stranded on a tiny island following a plane crash. However, the comment was only in jest, and was never meant to be taken seriously. Does anybody know where the opening scene with the 'cowboy' is set? Ton Hanks spends 4 years on the island, subsisting on nothing more than rainwater, coconuts, and fish. <br> <br>She sends him the wings on a package but the package is not important. In a prior scene, after Chuck returns from Moscow, he falls asleep on the couch of his home with Kelly, while a CNN anchor announces that “Just days before Santa departs on his annual gift-giving venture, he’s been declared physically fit to fly,” and then declares that “Santa Clause took off into the wild blue yonder for an early start,” presumably meaning prior to the traditional Christmas Eve start of Santa’s journey. <br> <br>Kelly's new house in the film is actually located at 74 Devon Way, Memphis, TN 38111. It should be easy to make a catch basin of some sort if necessary. Yet a main room in their house is dedicated to tracking Chuck. Definitely not in Moscow. The man she truly loved is lost to her, and she knows she cannot hurt her current husband by tearing their family apart for her own desires. Rather the Wings on the package are important. The joke being that if Hanks had just opened that last package, he would have been immediately rescued by calling for help. Jack!" She intended the wings to go to her cheating husband but instead they went to Chuck. Has anyone else reconciled this delivery route dilemma? I think Chuck doesn't open it in order to keep his sanity. <br> <br>Just because she still cares for Chuck (and maybe wishes things had turned out differently), doesn't mean she doesn't love her husband or wants to leave him. <br> <br>It had pink wings on it! The director Bob Zemeckis states in the feature voiceover that they changed it to a volley ball because "a soccer ball has all those black spots on it'. Check out the mistake & trivia books, on Kindle and in paperback. Maybe they sound identical but it still count as a character error. He is amazed and taken back a bit while Kelly acts like it's perfectly normal. We don't see how Chuck may have collected the rain water for future use. This scene shows what is coming as a whale wakes him up in time to see the ship. You can unsubscribe at any time. He had a bad tooth that he had delayed getting fixed, and an abscess developed in his gums. Answer: According to imdb.com, "Robert Zemeckis was asked at a Q&A session at USC what was in the unopened packaged. Chosen answer: The island's location could be determined by compiling pieces of information, including the dates and locations of where the plane crashed into the ocean, when and where the cargo ship found Chuck, and how long he was adrift to and from the island. I was wondering why this sounded familiar. In the easter eggs it says that you can find out what is in the un-opened FedEx package. Canadian is on Hwy 83 in the Texas panhandle. When finally delivering them home, Chuck writes "this package saved my life" when he means hope/love/salvation have saved his life. <br> <br>Addresses are not passed on to any third party, and are used solely for direct communication from this site. He knew when he left the island because he had created an analemma, a type of calendar that charts star movement throughout the year, seen on the cave wall. If that’s you, please travel safely, and send pictures. The hard part is not getting sick from drinking after crabs, amoebas and what have you, but there's plenty of sand and coconut husk to make a filtration system. The biggest mistakes in the Fast & Furious movies, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation trivia, The biggest mistakes in the Harry Potter movies, 25 mistakes you never noticed in great movies, The 20 biggest mistakes in The Wizard of Oz, 40 biggest mistakes in The Big Bang Theory. My thoughts exactly I just needed confirmation that all of this was reasonable to assume.  <br>Any fruits on the island would also provide fluids. What her husband was doing in Russia is never explained. Somewhere in the Great Plains, you heard the Woman's vague directions, "Whole lotta nothing 'till you get to Canada", and from the looks of things, it's not important anyway, the generic nature seems to be a plot device. Scurvy is prevented by Vitamin C, middle aged coconuts have Vitamin C in them, so that's scurvy prevented. <br> <br>Answer: In that area they have two seasons - the dry season and the rainy season. Cast Away (2000) (Don't lose hope at Barstow; then you hook up to I-15 to LosAngeles) 2 Comments Terri Muhich. It's not shown, but possibly he might have caught some birds, too. Coconuts come in a green shell which is their husk and they are hard to open up, especially when they get older. 1/2/2013 02:53:11 am. Most people use a machete or pick ax to get the husk off. We don't see how Chuck may have collected the rain water for future use. He's employing the fire trench method where the friction is created by rubbing one stick at a 45° angle against a trench in a wood plank (his trench looks to have been created because the plank was slit). No one knows what was in the package. Its a care package with a note imploring Bettina's (the artist) husband (naked cowboy) to come back and spice up their life like the salsa. The angel wings show that the parcel, The Angel wings are an important symbolic thread that run throughout the move. <br> <br>If you pay attention the sign at the ranch has both Bettina and her husband's name on it at the beginning of the film but by the end the husband's name has been removed. <br> <br>She also mentions that the next town heading west is Amarillo, so probably close to there. He was determined to make sure it got delivered just as he was determined to survive and get back to civilization. It's part of a group of islands called the Mamanuca Islands, in Fiji. In an interview with AFF Executive Director Barbara Morgan, Broyles discussed various aspects of the long-gestating development of the film. <br> Answer: Scurvy is prevented by Vitamin C, middle aged coconuts have Vitamin C in them, so that's scurvy prevented. All contents © 2016–2020 Grahm Donovan, except where otherwise indicated - All Rights Reserved. The angel wings show that the parcel Tom Hanks just delivered to the ranch belongs to the woman (who is an artist) in the truck. Chosen answer: Memphis is the "hub" for FedEx. I-40 is roughly 30 miles or so south of Canadian on 83. (02:00:30). He tells her not to open it until New Years. Very rarely have I seen a valid mistake regarding an actor calling a character the wrong name. [*See the Notes section below for more details.]. Cast Away is a 2000 American survival drama film directed and produced by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, and Nick Searcy.Hanks plays a FedEx employee stranded on an uninhabited island after his plane crashes in the South Pacific, and the film depicts his desperate attempts to survive and return home.

Good luck, cowboy. Bettina Petersen, the lady on the Texas ranch, sends a FedEx package to her husband in Russia.
