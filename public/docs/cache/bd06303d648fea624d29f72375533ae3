Beyond policy, though, Hegar has sought to make the race almost as much about character, pitching herself as a stronger avatar of Texas toughness. “Is it Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? In 1998, Cornyn was elected Attorney General of Texas, serving one term until winning a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2002. [27] Cornyn later said that the statement was taken out of context and for that reason he regretted the statement. To the contrary, Hegar believes she can overcome those disadvantages, at least in part, because she is up against an incumbent who continues to register as relatively unknown, especially given his long career in public life. [23] In the general election, he raised $14 million, outspending Democratic nominee David Alameel by nearly 3-1. [30] Cornyn advocated for Coleman to bring the case before the federal court, and said the trial and appeals could take years to complete. But Senator Cornyn thinks that's great (CNN): Sen.…, It's the morning after another night of protests and continued police violence has rocked our country, but cast your mind way back to mid-May. In 1998, Cornyn ran for Texas Attorney General. [67] Cornyn supported the Senate resolution expressing objection to the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories a flagrant violation of international law. Tell The Texas Tribune your voting story. Cornyn said: "I don't know if there is a cause-and-effect connection, but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country. I wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds up and builds up and building up to the point where some people engage in violence". Texas has not elected a Democrat in a statewide election since 1994, and according to Rasmussen Reports polling, in October 2008 Cornyn had an approval rating of 50%. "[92] He was rated "A" by the National Rifle Association (NRA) as of 2003[73] and 2014;[92] as of 2018[update] his NRA rating was "A+". More than any other race this fall in Texas, though, the U.S. Senate contest could be shaken up by the Friday death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which promptly sparked a battle to fill the vacancy, potentially before Election Day. Cornyn also previously served as Chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee  from 2007 to 2011. "[77], Cornyn voted to permanently repeal the estate tax and to raise the estate tax exemption to $5 million. Keep Informed. The last day to request a ballot to vote by mail is Oct. 23. [55][56][57][58], In 2013, Cornyn said that, despite the sequester, the Pentagon would actually see its budget increase. He is running for a fourth term in 2020. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1995. [35] His comments were criticized by some Democrats and the National Council of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. [73] He voted to prevent contributions to organizations that provide abortion as a component of family planning, and to prevent funding of organizations that support coercive abortion. "[90] Cornyn joined other Republican leaders to block Cruz's procedural move to reject an increase in the debt ceiling. [15], Cornyn was criticized by civil rights groups for failing to investigate in a timely manner the false drug convictions of numerous African-Americans in Tulia, Texas. McCain yelled an insult at Cornyn and said "I know more about this than anyone else in the room." Let us know if there’s something Cornyn is up to that we should cover. On September 6, 2002, the Austin Chronicle reported that Cornyn had announced that his office would investigate the 1999 drug bust, where the testimony of one narcotics agent led to the arrests of 46 people, 43 of whom were Black. [119] Cornyn receives pensions from three separate state and local governments in addition to his Senate salary. [76], In February 2019, Cornyn was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen urging them "to work with all federal, state and local regulators, as well as the hundreds of independent power producers and electricity distributors nation-wide to ensure our systems are protected" and affirming that they were "ready and willing to provide any assistance you need to secure our critical electricity infrastructure. Contact your county elections office for more details about both options. Learn more about voting by mail, check out our guide on voting during the pandemic and bookmark your Texas ballot. [51] He voted to recommend a constitutional ban on flag desecration and for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. Cornyn also previously served as Chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee from 2007 to 2011. [25], In 2005, Cornyn gained notice by connecting the Supreme Court's reluctance to hear arguments for sustaining Terri Schiavo's life with the recent murders of Judge Joan Lefkow's husband and mother as well as the courtroom murder of Judge Rowland Barnes. He was a judge on Texas' 37th District Court from 1985 to 1991. “The thing I enjoy the most about my job is actually solving hard problems, and sometimes it takes years to actually pass legislation, but … we’re kind of in a precarious time, not just in our state, because of the pandemic, but in the nation, and … so I think a steady hand on the wheel is even more important than usual,” Cornyn said during an interview earlier this month from his campaign headquarters in downtown Austin. [59], In April 2018, Cornyn was one of eight Republican senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and acting Secretary of State John Sullivan expressing "deep concern" over a report by the United Nations exposing "North Korean sanctions evasion involving Russia and China" and asserting that the findings "demonstrate an elaborate and alarming military-venture between rogue, tyrannical states to avoid United States and international sanctions and inflict terror and death upon thousands of innocent people" while calling it "imperative that the United States provides a swift and appropriate response to the continued use of chemical weapons used by President Assad and his forces, and works to address the shortcomings in sanctions enforcement.  John Cornyn goes on attack against challenger MJ Hegar in homestretch of U.S. Senate race. But that does not mean this year’s race is lacking in contrast. Whether it’s fighting for Hurricane Harvey relief, working to strengthen the criminal background check system to ensure convicted felons and domestic abusers cannot illegally purchase a firearm, or his dedication to providing much-needed resources to reduce the backlog of untested rape kits — Senator Cornyn has delivered for all Texans. [43], In September 2018, during the Supreme Court nomination hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, Cornyn accused the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee of devolving into mob rule by breaking the rules of decorum when asking for postponement or adjournment of the hearing to obtain or review documents from Kavanaugh's time working for the George W. Bush administration. In March 2016, he took the position that the Senate should not consider Obama's Supreme Court nominee. In the March Republican primary, Railroad Commissioner Barry Williamson received 38% of the vote and Cornyn, then a state Supreme Court Justice, 32%. Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the seat, and Gorsuch was confirmed. In 1998, Cornyn ran for Texas Attorney General. John Cornyn III (born February 2, 1952) is an American politician and attorney serving as the senior United States Senator for Texas since 2002. [23], In 2004, Cornyn co-founded and became the co-chairman of the U.S. Senate India Caucus. [citation needed], In 2008, Cornyn voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), also known as the Wall Street bailout, and later voted to end the program. “I would like to see the Constitution enforced,” he said. [46] The Dallas Morning News considered him a reliable ally of President George W. Bush on most issues. Cornyn also said that the voice of the people should play a role, and that the "only way to empower the American people" was having the vacancy be filled by the winner of the upcoming presidential election, so no hearings on Garland should be held. Asked if he wanted to see the lawsuit succeed, Cornyn did not say. :  Cornyn said, "I think the president can’t single-handedly remember everything, I’m sure, that he’s briefed on. [49][50], Cornyn sponsored a bill to allow law enforcement to force anyone arrested or detained by federal authorities to provide samples of their DNA, which would be recorded in a central database. [82] In April 2020, he claimed that climate scientists' models of the effects of climate change do not use the "scientific method. [89] Cornyn said that Senator Ted Cruz's 2013 efforts to defund the Affordable Care Act by threatening to default on the U.S. government's debt obligations were "unachievable", adding, "the shutdown did not help our cause. He voted against it in 2009,[85] and played a leading role in the attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. [34], On March 18, 2020, Cornyn blamed the COVID-19 pandemic on cultural practices in China and mistakenly blamed China for the MERS and swine flu epidemics. As chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Cornyn was a strong supporter of Norm Coleman's various court challenges to the 2008 election certification of the Minnesota U.S. Senate race. “I know that [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer was looking at those numbers and thinking, ‘Hey, if we could just put enough money into Texas, we can define Cornyn before he can define himself, and this is an opportunity,’” Cornyn said.
