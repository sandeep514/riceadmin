And has been hospitalized now for a little over a week. Published: April 03, 2020 at 06:43AM. So he, you know he’s -- his donor is coming tomorrow and -- and the blood draw will happen. Are we able to do our most essential work, even if it's hard and it's made more complex?” You know, like, we really -- I mean, that is, that is the little, tiny, tiny pearl at the center of all this, is that it forces us to say, “What is essential?” And part of that essentialness is connecting with other people. But the thing that jumped out at me the most, probably because of its, like, immediacy and the potential for, like, now -- of using it now, is blood transfusions. Also: we listen back to a mnemonic device (and song) that we created back in 2016 to help people remember the names of the justices. It became, you know, complex because it's really impractical, right? , Zeina Dowidar, and Hebah Fisher. It’s like, and we know that it’s you know safe in the sense that that blood was in another person. Came out of the woodwork! We lost a lot of people. That's the hope. Forgot Password? That's the hope. Chill out, ipDTL. Special thanks to Drs. To visit the Hospitality Flag website: https://declaremississippi.com/. The National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project. So I realized, you know, the same way that it didn't take very long for this, this outbreak to get completely out of hand and essentially close down the world, it also wasn't going to take very long for me to have a really large number of qualified donors who were -- had been infected and recovered. I was just looking, I just had another person while we've been -- while you called me back. But that still left DC without full representation in Congress; D.C. sends a "non-voting delegate" to the House. Yeah it’s three. And -- none of that's done. So you see a bit of a pause. They did it in a measles outbreak in Pennsylvania in the '30s. Take off the... JAD: I’m Jad Abrumad. Radiolab is a show about curiosity. It seemed to -- seemed to stop an outbreak. This is Radiolab is back. Or, register with specific NYC hospitals, , and are interested in participating in a clinical trial, or are looking for a plasma donor match, check in with your local hospital, university, or blood center for more; you can also find more information on trials at, The National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project, And lastly, Tatiana Prowell’s tweet that tipped us off is. I definitely want you to get back to saving peoples' lives though. It’s been used in MERS, that -- that respiratory infection, which is a coronavirus. And we see. Take off the... I’m Jad Abrumad. For more on Egon Schiele’s life, check out the Leopold Museum’s biography, by Verena Gamper. Special thanks to Stephen Wiesenfeld, Alison Keith, and Bob Darcy. As of Thursday night, when we finished this podcast, he was still in the ICU, still on a ventilator, hanging on. Like, the antibodies, right? So, like, what happens in the interim time? And if you are in the greater New York City area, and want to donate convalescent plasma, head over to the New York Blood Center to sign up. There's gonna be so much tragedy from this, right. To find out more about the The National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project, which we spoke about in our episode, including information on clinical trials or plasma donation projects in your community, go here. I mean, I just got all kinds of stuff. Over the years it has evolved to become a platform for long-form journalism and storytelling. And then second, we’re going to play you an interview that [sighs] really kind of knocked us all on our butts. Today, we tell the story of Professor Wang Yongmin, a hard headed computer programmer who solved this puzzle and laid the foundation for the China we know today. Diphtheria causes a thick covering in the back of the throat. Additional music for this episode by Podington Bear. Okay, BSL-3 time, we did that. A few days ago, that flag came down. And it's a way, honestly, for people who've experienced this illness and recovered to contribute at a time that, I feel like, the public really wants to contribute, you know? And of course, this is not a new concept. And there are a lot of things that distinguish a good death from a bad death, you know? What do the next couple of days look like for you, in the case of Papadoc? TATIANA PROWTRELL: Yeah it’s three. But wait a second. Support Radiolab today at Radiolab.org/donate. Use of this system is subject to all … Like hy are we talking about a ventilator?” And I just said, “I'm worried about you because you're falling asleep inappropriately and you're 83. More than a million people have caught Covid-19, and tens of thousands have died. Tell him the logistics stuff. It’s been used in MERS, that -- that respiratory infection, which is a coronavirus. The people who die, they'll never lay eyes on them again. JAD: Okay. I can, yeah. And I have the capacity, me, myself. Or, register with specific NYC hospitals, , and are interested in participating in a clinical trial, or are looking for a plasma donor match, check in with your local hospital, university, or blood center for more; you can also find more information on trials at, The National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project, And lastly, Tatiana Prowell’s tweet that tipped us off is, With the recent passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, there's been a lot of debate about how much power the Supreme Court should, Support Radiolab by becoming a member today at, started wondering this back in June, as Black Lives Matter protests and calls to “defund the police” ramped up. Host of Radiolab Jad Abumrad tells how his search for an answer led him home to the mountains of Tennessee, where he met an unexpected teacher: Dolly Parton.Jad Nicholas Abumrad is a Lebanese-American radio host, composer and producer. We've actually been doing it since the 1890s... What was it used for initially? Today we have the story of an experimental treatment that’s popping up all over the country: convalescent plasma transfusion, a century-old procedure that some say may become one of our best weapons against this devastating, new disease. Being free of pain and having closed all your loops. Like, he talked about it as, like, sharing immunity. And it comes from producer Sarah Qari. We can't do it without you. Or, register with specific NYC hospitals here. We did actually find a match. Thank you for listening. MOLLY: And so -- so a lot of times people aren't even seeing people until it's like really bad. And he said, “Oh I'm fine, I've just had a little bit of a cough, but I actually feel fine. Does it mean we should lower the voting age even further? And the thought is, is that the blood plasma is the part of the blood that holds anything that might have fought against an illness. And then saying “I know how awful that was, how scary that was, how -- how absolutely uncertain everything felt when I was sick. Certainly oncologists of a certain age, and I put myself in that category, I'm 47. Not only that, they might be able to pass this power on to the people who are sick with corona, and still in the fight. ARTURO CASADEVALL: I have been working on antibodies for my entire academic life. I don't know what. There's gonna be so much tragedy from this, right. Created in 2002 by host Jad Abumrad, the program began as an exploration of scientific inquiry. So I realized, you know, the same way that it didn't take very long for this, this outbreak to get completely out of hand and essentially close down the world, it also wasn't going to take very long for me to have a really large number of qualified donors who were -- had been infected and recovered. And they're also -- they also want to use it prophylactically. TATIANA PROWTRELL: Yeah, I can hear you fine. Everybody's quarantined. The show is known for its deep-dive journalism and innovative sound design. There are hundreds of people that want to donate! Back then, the rules were simple, outlawing nudity and gore. ARTURO CASADEVALL: And in that case, the serum didn't come from people, it came from horses. I don’t -- I couldn’t actually --  dip...theria. Give today. [laughs] I'm so sorry... TATIANA PROWTRELL: I know! Suzie Lechtenberg is our executive producer. Like, she literally pulled up to the ER and he went in and she's never seen him again. And I just said, “How's everybody?” and he said, “Oh, my dad's a little under the weather.” And I said “Wait, wait. Please contact your supervisor if you cannot remember your password. You know? But for somebody who doesn't realize that, they drive their family member up to the ER and that's it! And -- none of that's done. We're gonna lose lives of people that are on the front lines, as first responders, and as physicians, and nurses. Okay, great. The original "Lebanon USA" story was reported by Alex Atack with editorial support from Bella Ibrahim, Dana Ballout. And within minutes I had hundreds of people commenting, retweeting, private messaging me, telling me, “This is my blood type.” You know, “This is how many days ago I was sick. Twenty minutes a day, five days a week, ready by 6 a.m. We tried to make it as clear as possible. How close can words get you to the truth and feel and force of life?
