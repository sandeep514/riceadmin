Clemson will get a rematch of the lone home loss in that span when it faces Pitt in November. <br> <br>Clemson has won each of its last five meetings with Virginia Tech, dating to 2011, a year in which the Tigers earned two victories against the Hokies, including a 23-3 road win and a 38-10 victory in the 2011 ACC Championship Game. In all six of the previous instances, Clemson posted a winning record in those contests. OCT. 10 • MIAMI (FLA.) • MEMORIAL STADIUM, CLEMSON, S.C.
