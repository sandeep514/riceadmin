Upon delivery at Walt Disney World in August 1971, the vehicles weighed some forty tons, and were installed into a concrete guide (track), mounted on top of a mechanism that limited "bumping" accidents. Animatronic equipment directly under the lagoon for the turtle wranglin' scene. The ride involved a 20-minute submarine ride through a lagoon filled with sea life and mermaids. Though the attraction was a guest favorite and remained popular throughout its existence, it was expensive to maintain, as well as having a low hourly loading capacity for an attraction of its size and expense. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: Submarine Voyage was an attraction at the Magic Kingdom theme park at Walt Disney World from 1971 through 1994. All I remember clearly is a porthole, a whole lotta bubbles, and OH MY GOOD GOD THERES A GIANT SQUID ATTACKING THAT SUBMARINE! Despite the 20Ker’s best efforts, the line was often infamously long and hot. They had evolved their own in a place close to the center of the earth. What is it? I only rode it once when I was about 3 years old, but it kick-started a lifelong infatuation with the undersea world and more specifically, giant squids attacking things. The interiors were a mix of metal paneling, rivets, and bolts, as well as Victorian-esque fittings in the form of passenger seats that could flip outwards, and armrests beneath the portholes, in keeping with the Goff concept. Another veteran Imagineer, Bob Gurr, oversaw the project. Clearly none of them measure up to our beloved Disney World ride, but the pictures are certainly worth looking at.

Pooh's Playful Spot was built where the attraction formerly stood and operated between 2005 and 2010[5] before making way for the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train as part of the Fantasyland Expansion. At first there were precious few, but over time (and with the help of several 20K ride crew alumni) I've managed to gather quite an enjoyable collection, complete with video footage of the entire ride!

Following the standard Disney-style introduction and safety notes from the helmsman, the narration, in the voice of Captain Nemo, would begin.  Now join me as I salute the ride that cultivated the dreams of so many. But you're thinking about it right now and probably something is starting to stir deep inside you.

When the tour closed, the submarine was put in storage, but it has been taken out and displayed at various Disney events, still in fairly good condition. The third submarine was first moved to queue for the backlot tour at Disney's Hollywood Studios, but was eventually moved to an empty lot. With the ruins of the ancient civilization soon left behind, the Nautilus would enter the final phase of its journey, with a tribute to the most iconic and memorable part of the 1954 Disney film: The attack of the giant squid. The place where the guests end up was a world of Atlantis where mermen live. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea - The Ride. Each "guest" aboard the Nautilus had his or her own seat, as well as a round porthole to look out into the attraction.

Rising slightly, one of the final discoveries made is the ruins of Atlantis, along with a typical Disney-fied sea serpent, accompanying mermaids, and a treasury bursting with jewels and gold. The ride involved a 20-minute submarine ride through a lagoon filled with sea life and mermaids.[1].

"Commissioned" on June 6, 1959, in front of Richard Nixon, Walt Disney and his wife Lillian, and officers of the US Navy, the attraction made use of early animatronics to create underwater life, and the use of forced perspective to increase the feeling of realism. Eight submarines painted in grey took guests through the attraction, which took place in a lagoon visible from Tomorrowland and a large show building hidden behind two waterfalls. Two were shipped to be sunk in the snorkelling lagoon at Castaway Cay, Disney's private island. (And I had a great deal of time on my hands while I was unemployed for two weeks...).
