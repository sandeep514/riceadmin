</html>";s:4:"text";s:10437:"<p>This narrow theme produces a two-dimensional story that completely ignores the fundamental reason why the Italians were in the fighting in the first place: to achieve the strategic goals of Adolf Hitler. I fully respect military life and think that defenitively it makes you a better person. In the end, as with all wars, there are only losers…and both sides suffer grieviously. It's something like a good Vietnam movie from American directors, as "Platoon" or "Hamburger Hill". </p> <p>The initial hour covers small tales and little moments that break the boredom of life on the immobile front. </p> <p>Posted  on Mar 13, 2006 in Books and Movies, Front Page Features. the movie soundtrack is very exotic and fashinating, so you can feel the right atmosphere of desert land. </p> <p>El Alamein: The Line of Fire (2002) is an Italian film directed by Enzo Monteleone, set during World War II and starring Paolo Briguglia, Emilio Solfrizzi and Pierfrancesco Favino. </p> <p>Discuss this film on the Armchair General forums. This is a good movie of men in war, not a war movie Hollywood style. Rizzo comments that the patrol doesn't make sense because nobody would head for the Depression, not even Bedouins. The movie basically assumes you have some knowledge of Italian participation in World War II, and does little to set the stage or provide background. Point taken on the “88” issue. </p> <p>This film portrays the trials of a division on the front. It is a sad statement on their condition, but ultimately it rings true. Maybe over the years I have seen better war movies, but not many and certainly not from Italy. Surely one of the best Italian movies from the turn of the millennium, and a an apt and just requiem for those who gave their lives, or their best years, in the sands of Sahara. there's no vehicles to drive them off. Largely victims of Mussolini and his imperial ambitions, the Italian soldiers were sent out to fight a war in which they often had to be rescued by the more disciplined and better equipped German army. The ones which are driving away have no space for Fiore's platoon. As a result, this movie is dramatically flat. Of course, they promptly drive off and leave their men to the wasteland… As was true in reality, many Italians chose to be captured by the British rather than die in the desert well behind the front lines. EL ALAMEIN reminds me of that short and, in like fashion, leaves one shaking one's head at the madness of Men who would make war on other Men (for whatever "reason"). </p> <p>When the Tommies finally attack, I was torn as to which side I should root. </p> <p>(Most filmmakers opt for grandiose depictions of the Big Battles and totally ignore or dismiss outright the many unsung smaller battles that make up a war.) I just want to mention that article gets me closer to what it happened, fuel, ammunition & air support shortages against a well supplied/supported army. Rather, the question is why were they fighting in the first place, and any movie, especially a movie that is set in World War Two, that avoids dealing with that question is fundamentally flawed. </p> <p>I think they have right to obtain a more correct history-revision to give  truth to the truth. </p> <p>I must hereby add, that that feeling of believing the story was very much fed by the fact that in my opinion the director and his camera crew knew exactly what they were doing and I also would like to give a big compliment to the casting people. It's a saying that soldiering is 1% "action" and 99% boredom.  </p> <p>It is a motto engraved by the Italian Bersaglieri on a memorial stone near El Alamein. </p> <p>If you have the original, this is a free upgrade, but if not, $39.95 US are gonna be shekels well spent. Only near the end do we finally get a brief glimpse of the Italian Generals in charge; they laughably instruct the bedraggled soldiers to keep up the good fight. I recommend you look at it, see you and see you next review. Showing how Italy could fall in love for "Il Duce" was clearly out of this movie scope and reach, but perhaps it will help reading again this quotation attributed to a world expert in this field, Herr Hermann Goering: "People can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. </p> <p>El Alamein - La linea del fuoco subtitles, El Alamein - La linea del fuoco (2002).avi, El.Alamein.2002.iTALiAN.DVDRip.XviD.AC3.KLeZ, All subtitles for this movie in this language, Request this subtitle for a different release. The scene is absolutely terrifying. Presumably due to technical reasons the tanks attacked with headlights beaming (they would have been invisible otherwise) which would have made for some tasty targets in real life. Your email address will not be published. The fatal consequences to their civilian population, their relatives and families. I would have loved to have seen some historical pieces added to the disc to further educate the viewer on the Itialian army, El Alamein, and the war in North Africa. Metacritic Reviews. </p> <p>I generally enjoy war movies, particularly WW2, and I'm not obsessively fanatical about true-to-life details. In my opinion, as an Italian, I think this film is perfectly expressive of the sentiment of the battle of El Alamein and of the value of our soldiers (now completely forgotten) sent to fight a war that everyone considers unjust. Reproduction in whole or in part without permission is prohibited. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. Awards Rizzo and Lt. Fiore remain, because they were sleeping outside of the graveyard, and Rizzo's moral code was 'rather die than be captured'. Hey, we are in 2002, we have seen a lot of war movies like this. El Alamein: The Line of Fire (2002) is an Italian film about the plight of the Italian soldiers during and immediately after the climactic battle of North Africa at El Alamein. Furthermore, it had become a known fact that the amount of supply of fuel for mechanized units was to become very strategic in other theater of war. Only Pvt. </p> <p>Rizzo and Serra are sent by Lieutenant Fiore to the Qattara Depression to check what happened to an outpost which stopped responding to the command. The director tries to tell a story about Italian soldiers in World War Two, suggesting that they are hapless victims of incompetent commanders who basically had them fighting in a hopeless cause, period. </p> <p>It takes place during the Battle of El Alamein, and follows a group of Italian soldiers from the Pavia division, which is deployed in the south sector of the line, close to the Qattara Depression. In this respect, these and all soldiers should not be forgotten, we must remember what a total war is and try our very best to avoid it. One of the most effective shorts I ever saw was A TIME OUT FOR WAR. </p> <p>It's the day to day effort(s), the gradual grinding down, of the "ignoto" (the "unknown" soldiers) that make wars of attrition like this one worthy of closer scrutiny. </p> <p>go in places not even the Bedouins dare to go. The Reb watches as the two Yankees retreive the dead man... and the short ends with them resuming hostilities. This movie is about the men of Italy, and their life (and suffering) in the desert of North Africa. The British 25 lbr. has Serra tell him exactly where he found it, and realizes the British sent it to check if there was a passage in the minefield, and the fact it arrived to Serra's guard post means there's one. El Alamein: In the Line of Fire – Movie Review By Brian King. Don't miss it. But this movie is just not very good. On foot, the Italians became victims of their environment. Finally, it's retreat in confusion. External Reviews The optimistic student who goes to war in the belief that the Italian army will be in Caïro in no time at all, because he believed the public opinion and the promises of Il Duce back home like everybody else did. </p> <p>Not so great are things like story and character development. </p> <p>I first met “Armchair General” during a trip to South Korea (2005) and bought a magazine as a gift to my brother in law (former chilean army officer). FAQ </p> <p>Last Word: This movie is not a big budget war or action film, but is worth a look if you want to see an Italian perspective of the men who fought in the North African theater of World War II. </p> <p>Given its small budget, this is a fine little film about Italian troops abandoned in the face of the British counter attack at El Alamein in late 1942. </p> <p>They actually manage to get a truck at a medic post, but when they enter a shelter because of an airstrike, the truck itself is destroyed. on Axis shipping in the Mediterranean Sea, from the beleaguered Island of Malta. </p> <p>I am a seaman, chilean father of 47 years old, (21 years married, 3 sons & 1 daughter), my father used to talk to me and my brothers of the North Africa campaign and the Afrika Korps& Italian Army. War stories generally aren't told from the side of the losers, but maybe more should be. It shows the madness of war and (at the beginning at least) reminds me of the surreal atmosphere of another great movie, "Il deserto dei tartari". One aspect that I really appreciated in this movie is the fact that the plot focuses on the lives of soldiers and not on fascism and its politics. While many of us know the story of vast number of Italian soldiers who were bagged in World War II by the allies, this movie does a fine job of showing that these soldiers were as valiant and honorable as any other nation, despite often being set up to fail. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. </p> <p>Ill-equipped, ill-trained and ill-led, they were trounced by the British in North Africa prior to Rommel and the Afrika Korp's arrival, and later gave up the ghost in their own country with little resistance.
