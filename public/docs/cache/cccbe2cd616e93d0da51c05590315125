</html>";s:4:"text";s:10144:"In this dark (and dimly lit) scene, a woman’s breast is very briefly visible before these people are let go and fall to their death. When the experimental drug lacks the suppression they need, there appears to be no option but to euthanize Donovan. I haven't seen it on the OLED yet. How do we deal with death? This frames the beginning of the timeline with the miracle cure. Here, he has his ring -- he never "lost" it, because he didn't transgress from the vow he made with Izzy that the ring represents: This is why The Fountain is a beautiful movie for me. Skipping your post until I *do* see it. Tikal is mentioned by the queen's priest, however, it wasn't discovered until the mid 19th century, and the name Tikal ("place of voices") was applied only in the early 20th century by archaeologists. But we’ve become so preoccupied with sustaining the physical that we often forget to nurture the spirit. (We hear but do not see the impact.). I really, really hope we see The Fountain someday. It's another beautiful companion to the film. And as the conquistador traveled to the ends of the Earth, he would likewise willingly travel to the ends of the Universe in search of that cure. Frazzled and despondent, it's time to operate on yet another primate. In some ways, this message is very much in sync with Christian beliefs. Rather than some science fiction explanation for the two timelines, I took it more as a vision of the choice. I went to see the movie with my wife and it made me appreciate what I have and the utter despair and desperation that I would feel if I were in Tommy's place. And we cut it actually recently, it's done. 				  You cannot paste images directly. What do you think of the end of the Conquistador's story? That scene has a lot of impact for me, and is another rare example of a male lead shedding inhibitions and portraying real, visceral love. So I was always curious for myself to see what that alternative version would be. In different ways, both Tommy and Izzi (in each of their respective times and guises) respond positively to the reality of mortality. As Izzi dies of cancer in the present, she’s a model of healthy surrender and relinquishment. Instead, it assumes mankind is basically good and that eternal life is something we can achieve on our own. with "Yes, everything's allright", only to breakdown crying with despair moments later. And that's...., well, Awesome! One could be churlish and describe Tommy’s desire to be in control and to sustain Izzi’s life as denial. And what if we could somehow transcend mortality and live forever? But Arronofsky shows us Tommy's two distinct paths, each one leading him to The Road to Awe. Criterion's March titles include Being There (one of my favourite films), which I only mention here as it is another one they have licensed from Warner now, and a title Warner had previously put out on Blu-ray themselves in the past. And there was one version that was much closer to one of the scripts that we had. God’s name is taken in vain twice, and one person exclaims, “For Chrissakes.” There are also about half-a-dozen other milder vulgarities. I had secretly hoped that they might surprise us with The Fountain for its anniversary but obviously it has not come to pass. The Scientist thinks it is a cure for his wife. But then what is a good film if it doesn't truly illicit emotion? In a parallel universe where the film was a hit he'd probably have a gold statue on his mantle. Haven't had the chance in 13 years. And we kind of chose between which way we would go with it and they both are kind of interesting. We're only treated to two unique scenes of the second timeline, but they are both beautiful. What could possibly go wrong? We use … In his death, all other life came into being. And he believes that he has the skills to prolong her life. It's extraordinary how some filmmakers can signal a strong love with very little exposition. All three versions of Tom are searching for a secret to Eternal Life. My wife was flabbergasted by the movie, and until recently had not the patience to sit through it. Having lost Izzy, Tommy  exclaims "Death is a disease, just like any other. I went to see the movie with my wife and it made me appreciate what I have and the utter despair and desperation hat I would feel if I were in Tommy's place. That’s our goal.”. × As a modern-day scientist, Tommy is struggling with mortality, desperately searching for the medical breakthrough that will save the life of his cancer-stricken wife, Izzi. Even as his work leads him tantalizingly close—he discovers that the bark of a certain tree from Guatemala not only kills cancer but actually reverses the effects of aging—Izzi slips ever closer to succumbing to her malignant brain tumor. Carlucci,  I was lucky enough to get one and its exceptional on vinyl. Tommy is a present-day cancer researcher racing against time to find a cure for his terminally ill wife, Izzi. His spacecraft?  There's seriously not a better sci-fi love story. I think Astro Tom, for delivering the Tree to Xibalba and spurring new life, is "rewarded" with the do-over. Tommy knows he is pressed for time if he has any hope for a cure, so he rebukes her, and as she leaves in disgust, he starts to chase after her, and this is where the "present" timeline fractures in two, and travels down parallel, but vastly different, paths. It's the only scene where the present-day Izzy is depicted in full health, with long flowing hair, and it must be one of his happiest memories of their time together. The priest says the three points which form an equilateral triangle on the map are Chichen Itza, Yaxchilan, and Tikal. These philosophical questions frame director Darren Aronofsky’s latest mindbender, a sweeping love story about a man desperately laboring to save the woman he loves … in three different time periods spanning a thousand years. A primordial ether dissolves into blackness, and then as the final song, "Together We Shall Live Forever" plays, and as the credits roll, stars slowly blink into existence until the sky is full. The Presitge (still my favourite Nolan film) came out the same year so I very quickly became a big fan of Jackman in 2006 and its a shame he's not had enough roles since that tap into those depths of his talents because he is clearly one of the most committed to his performances in the business. For him the possibility of Izzi’s death—and, more generally, the fact that anyone has to die at all—is simply unacceptable. And while on the journey, he keeps flashing back to that "what if" moment -- That time when he could have chosen to spend even another second with Izzy. Another disturbingly violent scene depicts the Grand Inquisitor flagellating himself with a whip that leaves deep, bloody wounds on his back. The Conquistador thinks it will be an elixir he can carry to his Queen. He labels Isabel a heretic for pursuing immortality on earth. I love the artwork and agree it's a perfect companion to the film. Causa_Sui 11 months ago #1. A breathtaking transparent globe. Izzy? (It was originally rated R, then downgraded to a PG-13 after a few edits were made right before it hit theaters.) I'm going to listen to that commentary once I watch the movie again. We use "awesome" so much that we have dulled the impact and meaning of a word whose dictionary definition mixes emotions that are not normally combined, such as "dread" and "wonder." Indeed, for those who might otherwise be inclined to wade into moody and mystical waters, violent imagery, harsh profanity and a sexually suggestive scene may well render The Fountain‘s confusing spiritual and philosophical meandering moot. Stop dying. I think I would like to have that vinyl just to own it. It's rather uplifting when you really dig into it. Tommy's ring disappears -- he has defied his covenant of marriage, "until death do us part", and has now set forth on a path that would defy death. I would have to get Warner Brothers to support it and get it out there.". I still think it is Jackman's best performance. Aside from confusion of the meaning, I asked her what bothers her most. Here's the link for it for Carlos if interested: https://www.amazon.com/Fountain-FOUNTAIN-O-S-T/dp/B01NABRR50/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1481837149&sr=8-1&keywords=the+fountain+vinyl. Is this a movie that only 10% of people will enjoy, but those 10% adore it? Makes it tough on women viewers, I suppose. In the second timeline, revealed only after the entire plot of the first timeline has run its course, Tommy foregoes the surgery on Donovan, instead rushing to join Izzy in the "First Snow", leaving his assistant calling for him, wondering what to do about Donovan's surgery. And I will find it. She's coming to grips with her imminent death, while writing the book that will lead Tommy to his own acceptance of death as a part of life. The king of the Macrobians purportedly attributed his people's strength to their diet of boiled meat and milk. This is the last scene of the "present" timeline in which Tommy chose not to go with Izzy to the First Snow, and it is framed once again by a LFE signal. I'm unable to recall an equal scene with that depiction of grief by a male. In Wheeler’s world, “the Lady of the Fountain [is] a water sprite” who is able to control water –just like the Lady of the Lake (335). I think this is what happens in the movie - The defiant, angry Tommy discovers the cure for death, only to be left the last man alive, and traverses the heavens to deliver the tree of life (the old growth tree from Guatemala, not the Izzy seed) to Xibalba. But it should be noted that Aronofsky does not look at the realities of life and death from a Christian perspective. I have read and watched most every analysis I can find on the internet, and most do an adequate job of explaining the alternate theories about the meaning of the movie,  Most center around the 3 timelines, and whether "Astro Tom", traveling with a tree in a spherical spaceship, is a real timeline, part of Izzy's book, or Tommy's mind dealing with grief.
