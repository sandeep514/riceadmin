</html>";s:4:"text";s:10976:"<p>INCIDENT IN A GHOSTLAND aka GHOSTLAND is a film you’re not going to forget after viewing. In Ghostland (dir. I thought it was well executed but not as deep as Martyrs…but that’s okay . Usually I don’t leave comments like this but because of how much I love the movie I wanted to share a thought I had addressing Sharon’s points regarding the dolls. It is also deeply disturbing that a young actress was disfigured in a scene that remains in the film. Uber-fan of comics and horror. It’s the first time I hear this explanation and I think it’s awesome… it definitely makes sense and would explain her final line for sure! </p> <p>When you excel at pattern recognition on a technical level these weak story lines are so obvious, not in a clairvoyant way. What are some of your favourite horror flicks in the past few years?  With this movie you obviously don’t always get shown what’s actually happening and you already brought up that a lot of things are filtered by Beth’s imagination, such as the looks of the two culprits for example, so I was wondering if the whole “playing with dolls” is just another thing Beth made up to not accept reality. I mean The Endless set the standard pretty high and the story is so amazing, I’m actually pretty interested as to what they came up with for the prequel. </p> <p>(We also see her imaginary book “Dollhouse” a lot in her hallucination.). Incident in a Ghostland delivered more of the same but with a nod to Legion and other movies and series that question what it is to be sane. I haven’t reviewed YellowBrickRoad but I’ve seen it and I’m a big fan! But honestly, it’s an emotion I don’t need to have artificially boosted. When she arrives, her mother tells her that Vera is stuck in the past, and re-lives the assault by Fat Man and Candy Truck Woman over and over again in her mind. However, the police and the other characters in the movie always speak only to Beth, which might mean that your theory is right… I don’t know, I just like how many interpretations this film could have . ], My Most Anticipated Horror Movies of 2020. the two villains are monsters, because Beth would imagine them as actual deformed intruders since, in her eyes and mind, that’s what they are in fact. Acting as if it isn’t those things does a disservice to the film in my opinion. When the Davison family comes under attack during their wedding anniversary getaway, the gang of mysterious killers soon learns that one of the victims harbors a secret talent for fighting back. Sixteen years later when the daughters reunite at the house, things get really strange. great article and comments, just saw this last night, in fact I couldn’t finish it last night but am going to finish it tonight, I made it to just past the twist but had to get up for work this morning… So what is the significance of the kid in old fashioned costume in the beginning of the film? </p> <p>( Log Out /  I knew when she sat on the couch with her ageless mom and another writer was on tv on that phony looking book show that she was not married, no kids, mom was dead, and she’s still with the assailants and I hoped to god I was wrong because I watched to begin with thinking supernatural element but the typical bait and switch The Village style. If this interpretation is correct – I’m not certain about it, which is the main reason why I would like to interview Pascal Laugier for this blog – it would mean Incident in a Ghostland is a flawless, perfect horror film.  She could have escaped by yelling at the person who delivered groceries.  #21 – THE LANDING  Absolutely, it’s a fantastic film, I’m fine with em being pushed. I am glad he got me to put down the iPad and pay attention. I’m having an extremely hard time with this, I actually feel like watching that movie has ruined my life. </p> <p>Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You are commenting using your WordPress.com account. Ahahah thanks! </p> <p>As for the violence, I can do with less of that. Thank you so much for your more than kind words!!! I didn’t watch the movie in English and I’m not exactly sure what Vera says in the English version but it should be something like that she tried to defend herself last time and that only made it worse. That could be! What makes this movie so interesting to me is that there seem to be a lot of hidden details that kind of help you understand what’s really going on if you rewatch it and I just feel like with how well it’s thought out they wouldn’t just use a guy who likes to torture dolls for no apparent reason as a villain. </p> <p>There are, however, the so-called exploitation movies that are all about that: they’re underground filmmaking and definitely not for everyone, but that doesn’t mean they’re made by sick people and stuff. I won’t delve into that, because I know nothing about legal stuff, but it sure reaffirms the rumours according to which Pascal Laugier pushes the actors he works with to the limit in order to achieve a realistic performance. Ps: why the first time we see the sweets van, a REAL woman is driving, and not the bald guy with the wig? My interpretation would make sense as adult Beth, i.e. If you like Incident In A Ghostland you might like similar movies ... Log In More to explore. </p> <p>There aren’t many interviews online with the director due to the legal cause against him for Taylor Hickson’s injury… if you buy the DVD or Blu-Ray from Arrow Film, there are a couple of interviews with Laugier. Good point! As you said, after a wild ride, Martyrs hits you hard with an ending that’s really impactful and emotional… I teared up a little bit too at the end! Written by But the theory of a large part of the movie being in Beth’s mind is not that unrealistic, I was playing around with that idea myself. I want to restate that they didn’t bother me regardless: the film is great as it is and my grade didn’t change upon multiple viewings. I really don’t know! </p> <p>In general, I don’t have a favourite horror movie of all time… too many to choose from! The Blackcoat’s Daughter (2017) EXPLAINED. She realized and definitely knows she’s really good writing horror novels, and the way she reflects that is in that hypothetical way, telling the story by making the viewers think that characters are actually living that nightmare. Ghostland (OT: Incident in a Ghost Land) ist eine französisch-kanadische Co-Produktion und wurde vorranging in Kanada gedreht. Hello, i know I’m a little late and I’m not sure if this has already been stated but it was called Ghostland because no one was anywhere near that house to hear or know about the pain and torture they had been going through for 16 years in that house since the night her mother was killed. The twist “explains” that: Beth, who writes amateur horror novels, turns her hallucination into a horror film within a horror film. Thank you very much Sean, I’m glad you loved it too and this film is getting the praises it deserves.                 (2018). Meaning that at the end of the movie she goes for: “Beth do you practice sports” – “No, I write”, so what I understand is that she’s really hitting the ball out of the park! The scariest monsters are those who look like us. Hey! Also streaming on SHUDDER! Shudder’s August 2019 Releases Include First Six A Nightmare On Elm Street Films, Chopping Mall, NOS4A2.  </p> <p>Slash Film Plus Z! Bear in mind, in this scenario the assault and what the girls went through actually happened; however, they had a more cinematic feel to them because they got sifted through the filter of Beth’s imagination. </p> <p>If Incident in a Ghostland was written and directed by a random filmmaker, I’d say it’s just a sentence that implies Beth is scarred but not done with. Meanwhile, Vera (played by Anastasia Phillips as an adult) is left a reclusive basket case after the incident. I also really enjoyed your review. </p> <p>Just watched on Shudder last night and was blown away by the twists as you were! When Villanelle is in “killing mode”, I actually get more chills than anything in Ghostland. A father and son, both coroners, are pulled into a complex mystery while attempting to identify the body of a young woman, who was apparently harboring dark secrets. I agree with Tracey on many things actually. But on the night of their arrival, the girls' idyllic getaway turns into an endless night of horror.  #24 – THE BABYSITTER  God I hate it when people criticize a film because it is crude and violent towards women..i am a women..just because it makes you uncomfortable doesn’t mean it is bad..just because you don’t like watching doesn’t make it bad..if you don’t like violent horror movies then don’t watch them..in no way does showing this violence say that it is ok to do violence..infact I think it shows the opposite..this stuff really happens ..i think it’s important for people to know what that really looks like..so if you don’t like it ..dont watch it..it wasn’t showing women being hurt and raped to upbeat music saying yes. I thought it was a good & like Mother! One of the books is “The antique” by Link Gyles and in the newspaper article it says that the Gyles family are the latest victims of the “Family Killer”. Come see my words at MLMILLERWRITES.COM (https://mlmillerwrites.com/)			 There are some severely psychologically traumatized people in this movie, with lots of screaming and crying, jagged raw crying of people in absolute despair and frightened to the point they lose control of their bodies, even if the physical damage is often just a few scratches. Or like that Total Recall remake at the end when the guy looks at his hand and doesn’t see the tattoo. I saw a theory that  blew my mind off a while ago, and it’s that from the moment Beth escapes from the doll’s room everything is product of her imagination. I really enjoyed the film but this was something that did bother me. Loads is left to interpretation, so maybe my take on it is correct but it might just as well be a plot hole as you pointed out in your comment , I was truly jmpressed with ghost land but I didn’t understand it until I read your blog i understood at first then lost track but I still really enjoyed the film it was very emotionally charged at times and the doll scenes were freaky beyond belief a truly stunning scary unique film that will scare the crap out of you, Thanks for your comment. Could it be that Beth was using these coping mechanisms and her writers talents to concoct these two “monsters” when in reality it was her sister who was the real monster? Retro-Best in Horror 2017-2018 #6 INCIDENT IN A GHOSTLAND! However, these films have a combination of genres and do incredible in their executions. I’ll pay attention at these details next time I watch Ghostland. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:35:"movies like incident in a ghostland";s:5:"links";s:9698:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/clemson-2020-football-schedule-86e6ec'>Clemson 2020 Football Schedule</a>,
