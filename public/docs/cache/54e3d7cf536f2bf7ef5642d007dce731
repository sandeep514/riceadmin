Cinematography’s one of those things that, if it’s done really well, you don’t notice it, so I just wanted to take a moment to bring attention, at least, to some times where it’s done well. You learn more from failure than from success. And what we’ve done with this game is what we coin as filmic … We’ve used [techniques] that are very movie-like … to build the game.”. </p> <p>Cutscenes actually flow smoothly between exposition and gameplay without jarring shifts from one graphically polished reality, to another that looks visually mismatched. If it happens too often, those less-than-satisfactory scenes will add up and undermine whatever goodwill the rest of their game had.
