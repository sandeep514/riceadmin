The National Institute for Elopement Prevention and Resolutionâs (NIEPR) definition ofÂ patient elopementÂ is: When a patient or resident who is cognitively, physically, mentally, emotionally, and/or chemically impaired; wanders away, walks away, runs away, escapes, or otherwise leaves a caregiving facility or environment unsupervised, unnoticed, and/or prior to their scheduled discharge. They can run into other patients that may be mentally ill and could harm them. Patients with certain mental illnesses often have some type of memory loss that causes them to forget where they are.

The only way to impress upon them the importance of keeping our loved ones safe is to hold them legally responsible when their carelessness causes harm. Patients in facilities like these who suffer from mental disabilities have a tendency to wander away. They can easily get lost, losing all recollection of where they are and how to return to safety.
