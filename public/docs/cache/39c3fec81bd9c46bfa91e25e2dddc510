Van Wey, Presby & Williams can help those who wish to fight back against unprofessional, negligent nursing homes, hospitals and mental health care facilities and staff. Elderly people, especially, who suffer from mental disabilities like Dementia or Alzheimer’s are often frail, vulnerable and in a precarious state. These types of alarms are most effective when they are paired with an individualized plan to prevent nighttime injuries. 0000013326 00000 n Jennifer Thew, RN, is the senior nursing editor at HealthLeaders. Mental health facilities and nursing homes may lack training or the proper equipment as well. It also occurs every day in hospitals and mental health facilities all over the United States.

Staff must be aware of each patient’s likelihood and potential to wander off to be able to assess them correctly. 0000013234 00000 n 0000001455 00000 n The ProblemPatient elopement is a very real problem that most organizations have experienced at one time or another, but it is rarely discussed. 0000001749 00000 n Facilities with patients who could potentially wander off must assess each patient’s tendency to wander or leave the facility at the beginning of their stay. Describe strategies for preventing elopement and steps for responding after a patient elopement has been identified. Patients elope in a number of ways. They can wander near facility visitors who may have bad intentions and harm them. 0000003607 00000 n When patients wander away from health care facilities, nursing homes, mental health hospitals or other assisted living facilities, the result can be tragic. Statistics indicate that in the United States, more than 34,000 Alzheimer patients wander out of their homes or care facilities each year. As the baby boomer generation ages, the number of people with dementia is rising steadily. "Preventing patient elopement is a concern we all face, especially for those patients who are at risk for harming themselves or others," Shehan says. 0000002232 00000 n 0000008128 00000 n Consider these three scenarios of patients who have wandered away from safety and right into danger: A mentally disabled patient living in a mental health care facility needs some dental work done. Workers have been known to act unprofessionally or to be overworked, though this is no excuse for the neglect of mentally ill patients and it is absolutely unacceptable. 0000016381 00000 n In addition to keeping a close eye on residents, it is important for nursing home staff to make sure that the alarms on exits work correctly. trailer The best solution for preventing patient elopement and wandering is, without a doubt, the careful monitoring of patients or residents. The National Institute for Elopement Prevention and Resolution’s (NIEPR) definition of patient elopement is: When a patient or resident who is cognitively, physically, mentally, emotionally, and/or chemically impaired; wanders away, walks away, runs away, escapes, or otherwise leaves a caregiving facility or environment unsupervised, unnoticed, and/or prior to their scheduled discharge. They can run into other patients that may be mentally ill and could harm them. Patients with certain mental illnesses often have some type of memory loss that causes them to forget where they are. Also, the environment should be comfortable and basic needs should be met, lessening the desire of a patient to elope. Every issue must be taken into account and taken seriously. 0 We conclude that it is because of healthcare provider negligence. 0000056067 00000 n With all of these technological advances that can effectively prevent patients from wandering, why is the problem still growing? 0000000016 00000 n The reason events like these are so tragic is because they are entirely preventable.

While elopement results in a patient leaving the facility altogether, wandering is when a resident leaves a safe area within the nursing home or long-term care facility. The only way to impress upon them the importance of keeping our loved ones safe is to hold them legally responsible when their carelessness causes harm. Patients in facilities like these who suffer from mental disabilities have a tendency to wander away. They can easily get lost, losing all recollection of where they are and how to return to safety. Procedures of this type must be put in place, staff must be trained properly, and the procedures must be followed properly. They can wander into busy streets, intersections and traffic. 274 0 obj<>endobj             They can be exposed to hazards, such as extreme hot or cold weather conditions.

This happens often times because they are understaffed or the staff simply lacks the knowledge and expertise to prevent patients from eloping. Often, the patient may keep wandering further and further trying desperately to remember where they are, and they never do. This can include the following: Without careful supervision, which is mandatory, none of these solutions are fool proof. 0000046909 00000 n 0000148681 00000 n 274 36 Mental health facilities are responsible for making sure patients don’t wander into danger or harm themselves or other patients. No matter how elopement occurs, there are consistent, proactive ways to better prepare an organization and its staff to better deal with the issue. However, the alarm system is not working properly, and the patient wanders out of the facility into winter weather. 0000004828 00000 n All patients should be assessed, even those who may appear unlikely to leave or wander. More and more, nursing homes and assisted living facilities lack the proper resources to properly care for wanderers. 0000016871 00000 n ... HHS lawyer: President Trump's drug cards could violate election law, Poll: ACA more popular than ever as SCOTUS vote looms. When we feel that we are not properly equipped to handle or care for a loved one with special cognitive needs, we turn to specialized facilities who are better equipped to care for them. 0000114042 00000 n By Jennifer Thew RN  |   December 06, 2016. Bed alarms are frequently used for the resident who leaves the bed at night to wander and/or is at risk for falls/injuries. Studies vary on the prevalence of wandering in institutionalized dementia patients, but it is estimated that 11 to 24 percent will wander. A senior citizen is supposed to be closely supervised because he has severe Alzheimer’s. Unfortunately, the staff at facilities who care for mentally ill patients can just be flat out uncaring.
