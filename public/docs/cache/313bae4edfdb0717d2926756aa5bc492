</html>";s:4:"text";s:8728:"He knows all the tricks of the trade, even renaming everyone in the farmhouse/compound. Eat Snacky Smores. Copyright 2005-2013. I haven’t been able to see Durkin’s 2010 short film, “Mary Last Seen”, that both helped him secure financing to make, and served as a quasi-preface to, “Martha Marcy May Marlene”. This is made all the more intimidating because events like these have happened, and are still happening. She’s fearless in her approach, baring her body and soul in order to convey the effect Patrick and his flock have had on Martha. It’s also not about getting a concrete resolution, there is ambiguity to how the story plays out, which is greatly appreciated by myself but not so much by others. ** The opinions on this site are done for entertainment purposes only, mostly mine. She seems to have forgotten societal norms, having replaced them with whatever manner of action was deemed acceptable at the farmhouse. To that end, the rest of the cast is also spot on. Personally, I believe that Martha/Marcy was staying with her sister FOR THE CULT (PATRICK). The story flips back and forth between the present and the past, in a number of very well conceived and executed transitions that help blur the timeline. I would have been very disappointed if they spelled things out too clearly as they did such a nice job of keeping Martha’s internal struggle somewhat of a mystery. If you’re one of those people who need a beginning, middle, and end, this is going to test you.  martha marcy may marlene alternate ending Elizabeth Olsen delivers a tremendous performance, showcasing just about every emotion in the human repertoire. All images and screen shots are the property of their respective owners. As they drive away, Martha, who is seated in the back seat, turns to see the man get into a brown car and chasing them. It’s never quite clear what the endgame will be, or if the adage that ‘It’s not paranoia if they’re really out to get you’ applies in these circumstances. The film begins with her escaping from the cult and staying with her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and brother-in-law, Ted (Hugh Dancy). 		is powered by		WordPress 3.1.4 Paulson beautifully plays the role of big sister/de-facto mother. As for seeing this on the big screen, it’s not necessary but I’m of the mind that any good film is better in a theater than at home (unless you’re a gazillionaire and have a ridiculous home theater … by the way, if that’s true, invite me over). It’s easy to see why Martha disappeared from her life in the first place but also that the fracturing in their relationship was due to faults by both parties. It’s all about the present, and where Martha is at this very moment – with back-story filled in over the course of things to explain the haunted look in her eyes evident from the outset. It’s clear that Patrick has an innate sense of finding vulnerability in people and exploiting it for his own gain. Glad Hawkes turned in another nice performance, btw. Well, for Martha (Elizabeth Olsen), it’s a similar rap from Patrick (John Hawkes) that helps hook her into a makeshift family of young adults (think Charles Manson) in writer/director Sean Durkin’s “Martha Marcy May Marlene”. Agh. Audiences are only given bits and pieces of Martha’s life at Patrick’s farmhouse, dosed out measure by measure as the story unfolds. Dancy delivers another surprisingly understated and yet effective turn (part of that due to my blind spot for remembering his real name until the credits rolled) as the brother-in-law trying to be supportive of his wife’s wish to take care of her family, while also being wary of Martha’s bizarre behavior as an indicator of worse things to come. Sobering Conclusion This kind of uncertainty takes a great deal of precision by everyone involved; from Durkin himself, to editor Zachary Stuart-Pontier, to the entire production team, and to the actors. With Martha, that new moniker is Marcy May (the Marlene explanation comes much later). It is open for interpretation (which I personally do not like…….I hated how The Sopranos-an amazing TV series ended by turning to black). The film begins with her escaping from the cult and staying with her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and brother-in-law, Ted (Hugh Dancy). Elizabeth Olsen delivers a tremendous performance, showcasing just about every emotion in the human repertoire. Patrick is the savior/provider of the group, and with it come the spoils – mostly in the form of laying with each of the ladies that have been assimilated into the cult. He mixes in the right balance of snake charmer, father figure, and tyrant to catch people in his web. And rather than follow the traditional A-B-C story structure, we are merely given the basic structure of the cult through Martha’s eyes as she tries to bury those memories and readjust to the way society works outside of Patrick’s sphere of influence. You’re a teacher and a leader. With Martha, that new moniker is Marcy May (the Marlene explanation comes much later). Just how far those changes have rewired her thinking is the elephant in the room. However, if that isn’t a red flag, the rewards to seeing the film are great. Martha Marcy May Marlene ending explained: During the film’s end, an anonymous man from the dock walks past Lucy and Ted’s car, after they make their escape. To me, this ending was wonderful. Januar 2011 wurde der Film … Watching the trailer, it’s clear how it leads to where the long-form version begins; and Brady Corbet being in both helps create the literal connection. The nice thing is that you can interpret the ending how you feel it is going to end up. The final scene indicated to me that she was almost glad that the cult was coming back for her because she felt betrayed by her sister who was going to have her institutionalized. Marlene is the name all of the women give when they answer the farmhouse phone. Because, this movie does an amazing job of dovetailing back and forth and back and forth between the past and the present. It seemed to me that based on the title of the film that she was re-abducted into the cult, her new name at the end being Marlene. I have a feeling that the cult member followed them home and basically killed the sister and brother-in-law and took Marcy back and she was re-named Marlene. 		 and delivered to you in 0.335 seconds using 36 queries. However, for those who enjoy character studies and/or the effects and methodologies of cults, “Martha Marcy May Marlene” gets a 4 out of 5, and lands itself on a sadly short list of memorable films so far in 2011. The story flips back and forth between the present and the past, in a number of very well conceived and executed transitions that help blur the timeline. As such, it would have been nice to attach it to this theatrical release, much like the Edgerton brothers showed their short, “Spider”, before “The Square” (it even had a small, subtle tie into their feature); maybe it’ll be a nice extra on the DVD. It’s a harder sell because most audiences want to see plot progression, and might not be content with watching Martha on the beginning of her journey back to “normality”. She is literally on the road to recovery, yet is still followed by her past. Understanding the timeline of Martha Marcy May Marlene may help most of you the most. And of course, in order to make the whole premise work, you need an outstanding performance from the cult leader, to which John Hawkes acquitted himself superbly. It’s just that no one has had the trust in you to say so. Filmography links courtesy of The Internet Movie Database. Originally Answered: What are some plausible interpretations to the ending of Martha Marcy May Marlene? Using words like that, am I any closer to recruiting you into my super awesome cult? Martha Marcy May Marlene Explanation Deep Dive. Any similarity to a real review or actual information is unintentional and unfortunate. Just be aware of your preferences. Not only did it cement the film in my memory (the ghost of Martha's fate is still wandering … I … understand. Your child will love the shirt just as much. That’s the beauty of Durkin’s film – the unpredictability. No? They don’t love you like I do. The ending of Martha Marcy May Marlene [spoilers within] : TrueFilm 13 votes, 12 comments. This entire reviewed revved up my already ridiculous need to see this movie. While not based directly on any one cult, Durkin managed to color everything with the right brush to allow audiences to watch Martha’s story unfold and, should anything be left off-screen or out of the final cut, to imagine the worst.
