We want to hear what you have to say but need to verify your account.                         |, April 30, 2020 Identity is a short film by KJ Adames.                      The ideas the film raises are dark and creepy but at the same time, manages to make you think about mental illness. Metacritic Reviews. Hopefully that continues moving forward. Huh huh!" I hope that clears it up a little bit. Soon they realize they may be at the motel for another reason when one by one, people start getting killed off. Enter your location to see which It's as gray as Go was colorful and a cool contrast to its source material. As the body count mounts, the stranded travelers struggle to find out who the killer is; however, they also learn each of them has a secret, and that their arrival at the motel has not been a matter of mere chance.                         | Rating: 3.5/5 As each character dies, that is one less personality he has left. Luckily, after so long and many repeated viewings, The Bourne Identity still holds up. I like surprise endings, but they have to be somewhat realistic. Ingenious, how simple and yet how devious the solution is. Summaries A man is picked up by a fishing boat, bullet-riddled and suffering from amnesia, before racing to elude assassins and attempting to regain his memory. This movie was absolutely fantastic. Today I have watched "Identity" for the second time in less than two months, now on DVD. However, this can be attributed to artistic license, the reveal definitely added to the atmosphere of suspense. No one can escape.                                                                People would definitely have a hard time believing that a nine year-old mute boy was responsible for murders if the tale took place in reality. However with him dead the deaths continue - each with a room key forming a morbid countdown as the remainder try to survive the night.                                It's a worth see, inventive film and with a great cast to back it up. Because of what seem to be unusual circumstances, eleven people, strangers to each other outside of their respective "groups" (two families, two professional associations), end up stranded in a desolate Nevada motel on a dark, stormy night. action,                                            The Stepfather who followed the letter of the law almost obsessively compulsive and even recited them. when you purchase 3 participating Suave products 9/1-10/31 at Walmart or Walmart.com. The movie takes that background and sets the scene in the very same atmosphere that Malcom was traumatized in. Stranded at a desolate Nevada motel during a nasty rain storm, ten strangers become acquainted with each other when they realize that they're being killed off one by one. It's one thing to tell a lie in a movie, the other is to show it to the audience as if it was the real thing. Those still alive band somewhat together under Officer Rhodes and Ed's direction to find out which of the eleven is the murderer, and if, based on one of their theories, that they were brought to the motel by some force by the murderer as his intended targets. I would give 9 -at least- out of 10 to Identity. ... Parents need to know that this is a very scary movie with a lot of intense peril and some grisly and upsetting deaths. Interestingly, during my research, I discovered that there are quite a few things ‘Identity’ got spot on. This is not necessarily true in the case of a person with Dissociative Identity Disorder. But really that kid is still alive, and he kills Amanda Peet. When the mysterious killer reveals out to be a child of my age or even younger, that had always gotten me into an excitement. He sets out on a desperate search-assisted by the initially rebellious Marie (Franka Potente) - to discover who he really is, and why he's being lethally pursued by assassins.                            [Real World] Convict Name: Malcolm Rivers. Get the freshest reviews, news, and more delivered right to your inbox! Identity provides a "double mystery"--a traditional whodunit and an increasingly bizarre "rubber reality" mystery that we must figure out along with the characters. I wish I had more room to write as I can talk about the psychological relations that were represented in each character of the movie all day. +Supporting cast The best-selling suspense novel by late author Robert Ludlum comes to the screen for a second time, following a 1988 made-for-TV movie. We want to hear what you have to say but need to verify your email.     |                         They are: ex-cop now limo driver Ed, and his client Caroline, a diva of a once famous actress; quiet adolescent Timmy, his stepfather George, and his mother Alice, who was seriously injured when Ed accidentally ran over her as she watched George change their flat tire; prostitute Paris, who was the unwitting cause of George's flat tire; newlyweds Lou and Ginny, whose marriage is based on a lie; and Police Officer Rhodes, who was en route escorting prisoner Robert to his new institution. Before Paul Greengrass came on board and gave us a few heart stopping thrill rides, Doug Liman directed the first entry in the series.     |                         It's also far less cinematic than its successors and in turn makes for a great cable watch (which is probably why I've seen this film north of 10 times). Looking for movie tickets? ‘Identity’ is one of those films in which you always know that there is something more going on than what is shown on the screen but you can’t quite put your finger on it.             | Fresh (159) Malcolm Rivers has been convicted as the perpetrator of several murders and is sentenced to death.                         | Rating: 3/5 The big reveal in the film is made when Ed slips between imagination and reality. Even sane people have many different aspects to their personality, but they don't let them become dominant -- they are controlled. Whether those still alive can discover who the murderer is, discover why he has chosen to kill them, and be able to subdue him may well determine Malcolm's fate. The Premise as you will read here on IMDB or on the back of the dvd in the shop/rental store seemed very lame to me but I was so wrong. Malcom Rivers remembers his mother as a whore and that he was abandoned at the age of nine and found in a motel.                      The prostitute mother (Amanda Peet), the part of him who hated her for being a prostitute (Larry), the loving mother he wish he had, the loving father he wish he had, the selfish part of himself (actress), the violent part of his personality (Ray Liotta and Busey), the irrational emotions he feels and his need to be loved (Ginnie) and his attempts to control those feelings (Lou), the hurt little boy who sees far too many traumatic things in his life, and of course, John Cusack who seems to represent Malcolm himself trying to analyze and understand all the craziness in his mind, tries to follow the rules (accepting responsibility for the car accident), help others (giving Amanda Peet a ride, and stitching up the mother). It's the easiest trick in the book, of course you'll be surprised, anybody will. Fall TV First Look: Find Out What’s Coming, The Best Peacock Original Shows and Movies, All Upcoming Disney Movies: New Disney Live-Action, Animation, Pixar, Marvel, and More, Look at us, Look at what they make you give. Watchable, but overall a disappointing waste of talent. But Mangold doesn't gives the twist at the very end, and keeps a tense film until the last frame. Paris Nevada: Played by Amanda Peet, her character sort of speaks for herself, the fleeing prostitute, who wants to leave her past behind and start afresh, something which Rivers wished that his mother had done and something that would have probably saved her life.                         | Rating: 8/10 Ginny and Lou (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott) are a not-especially-happy pair of young marrieds on their honeymoon.                                                  |, July 20, 2002 With 4 successful films under its belt to this point, and one more on the way, Jason Bourne has become one of Hollywood's most enduring protagonists. With this late evidence brought forth, a new hearing takes place on a stormy night in which Malick will try to persuade the Judge to spare Rivers. I didn't like it quite as much this time, although it still earned a "B". This is a mix of several genres, from thriller, to mystery, a who'dunnit with gore.
