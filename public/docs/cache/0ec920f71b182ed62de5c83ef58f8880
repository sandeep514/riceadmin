Naomi Hunter (ナオミ・ハンター, Naomi Hantā), nicknamed Dr. Naomi (ドクター・ナオミ, Dokutā Naomi) by her staff as opposed to the more formal Dr. Hunter, is a geneticist by practice,[24] and specializes in nanotechnology-based gene therapy. This unit specializes in black ops, carrying out top-secret operations within "unauthorized" combat zones which are too politically sensitive to intervene in through conventional means. [100] Though she became engaged to Raiden, their relationship ended after Rosemary supposedly had a miscarriage. He eventually learns that the explosives Fatman planted were decoys used to activate the real bombs set to destroy the foundation of Shell 1 and Shell 2. [61], Johnny later returns for a pair of voice-over only cameos in Metal Gear Solid 2. After he gives away his detonation code to Ocelot, Snake is unable to rescue him before as he is killed by the FoxDie virus. [24] The group is initially believed to be led by an inner circle of 12 people known as The Wisemen's Committee (賢人会議, Kenjin Kaigi). Because the airstream of English R is also on the top of the tongue, so when the Japanese R is pronounced in the 2nd way, it sounds like English R for English native speakers. [39] He is married to Rosemary which causes a rift between him and Meryl, now aware that Campbell is her father. Code Talker (コードトーカー, Kōdo Tōkā) is a Navajo biologist who specializes in parasite research. He also talks to Naked Snake about sightings of the Peace Walker AI weapon (which he calls "El Basilisco"). As Raiden meets with him, Fatman reveals that he wishes to become the world's most famous bomber by surpassing Stillman. [128] A sadistic brute of a man, Volgin delights in causing wanton destruction and inflicting pain on anyone who crosses his path. It physically spells Snake http://i.imgur.com/x2W1tA5.jpg. What’s the word meaning a person who assumes that he knows everything but actually doesn't. Bladewolf is tricked by Mistral into killing Khamsin, whom she believed to be becoming a problem. His character was most likely named after a character in Paul Auster's New York Trilogy. She is also an avid movie-watcher, and enjoys discussing her favorite films with despite Snake's disinterest. Kazuhira Miller was also revealed to have been affiliated with Cipher as a neutral business partner, although it was also implied Miller quit upon learning about Cipher's plan to frame MSF. By The Phantom Pain, Skull Face has fallen out of favor with Cipher and has been exiled to Africa where he revives a project designed to weaponize a parasite as a form of ethnic cleansing as the parasite targets and kills speakers of different languages. In Metal Gear Solid 2, the Patriots manipulate the story's events. The character's likeness was provided by Lyndall Jarvis. Also, his face is revealed for the first time in the series. The Patriots. I don't have a picture or I'd post it.           3. ã column  [75][76] He does battle with Snake twice, the first battle with Raven in an M1 Abrams tank,[77] the second in a freezer with Raven being killed. [56] Every time Snake saves his data, Mei Ling provides him with advice through Chinese proverbs, as well as quotations from Western authors. Quiet (クワイエット, Kuwaietto) is a sniper who appears in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. She invents Solid Snake's wireless communication system, the codec radio, as well as the Soliton Radar, which detects the positions and field of vision of nearby enemy soldiers. The girl went back to East Germany and underwent numerous ESP and psychic tests. However, Skull Face gets betrayed, leaving him crushed under a broken girder while Venom Snake defeats ST-84. Boris Popov is voiced by Takayuki Sugo in Japanese and by JB Blanc in English. Aleksandr Granin is voiced by Takeshi Aono in the Japanese version and by Jim Ward in the English translation. According to the developers' commentary in Metal Gear Solid: Integral, Hideki was known among the staff for his slackoff behavior and the character was included in the game as a running gag. Lt. Cunningham is an African-American soldier and FOX's resident interrogation specialist that goes by the codename Boa. God dammit, I really need to play mgs4, but fuck beating the advent palace. [97] Rosemary also supports Raiden by providing information about the Big Shell facilities and the other characters Raiden encounters in the game. These feelings manifest in the physical world as a representation of those emotions. [1][2] Once Yoji Shinkawa started designing the characters in PlayStation's Metal Gear Solid, they were given their respective established visual appearances. She is introduced in Metal Gear Solid as Solid Snake's sidekick/love interest and Roy Campbell's legal niece/biological daughter. This has utterly numbed her to bloodshed and has spawned an obsession with laughter, particularly during battle. Various materials stated also that he was originally a third-generation Japanese-American who has served in the SAS, Green Berets and USMC. In Metal Gear Solid, he is taken prisoner by FOXHOUND,[83] and tortured by Revolver Ocelot then rescued by Solid Snake. A nearby cult took offense to the village's diet and attacked, sparing few, including the young girl. Press question mark to learn the rest of the keyboard shortcuts. His appearance enables him to convert the energy from firearms and explosive rounds into powerful attacks. The Pain (ザ・ペイン, Za Pein) has the ability to control hornets at his will, through the buzzing of a queen hornet that he keeps in his backpack. He takes little satisfaction with vengeance on Skull Face. Her Naomi Hunter impersonation is voiced by Hiromi Tsuru in Japanese and by Jennifer Hale in English. [31] He then reveals to Snake that NATO led a bombing raid against Outer Heaven, not caring about the war orphans or war refugees. So how to pronounce ããããã? [42] Introduced in Metal Gear 2, Miller is a member of FOXHOUND and one of Solid Snake's radio contacts, having been Snake's mentor. Paz Ortega Andrade (パス・オルテガ・アンドラーデ, Pasu Orutega Andorāde) is first introduced in Peace Walker as an innocent schoolgirl at the University of Peace. D.D., short for Diamond Dog, is a trained wolf who assists Diamond Dogs in The Phantom Pain. 5. He possesses a red bionic right hand with built-in lighter and also can be launched like a rocket. Their insignia is a mirror of the FOX unit; XOF's insignia is a black fox on a yellow background. Over the course of the story, he identifies these feelings as being strongest in Eli and their relationship becomes symbiotic, magnifying the boy's power even further and allowing Eli to take control of Metal Gear Sahelanthropus. La li lu le lo in kanji it spells Snake. Venom Snake finds the orphaned puppy on the field and brings him back to Diamond Dogs, where Ocelot trains him to support on missions. He makes an unvoiced appearance in the end of Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, where he can be seen standing next to Major Zero during FOXHOUND's inauguration ceremony. la bu .         6. ã¯ column Once known as one of the world's best figure skaters (with stints in the world championships and the Olympics under her belt), Heffner was stripped of her competition rights after being caught in an attempt to seek political asylum in Canada with Frank Jaeger. The Metal Gear franchise features a large number of characters created by Hideo Kojima and designed by Yoji Shinkawa. Zero (ゼロ), real name David Oh (デイビッド・オウ, Deibiddo Ō), also known as Major Zero and Major Tom,[121] is the founder of the FOX unit and the true main antagonist of the entire Metal Gear series. In Peace Walker, Cipher has their agent Pacifica Ocean to oppose and frame MSF for a nuclear strike against the East Coast. The player is also able to wear a mask to impersonate him as Kojima noted that there were fans who wanted to play as Raiden in Metal Gear Solid 3. I was under the impression that La-li-lu-le-lo itself was a reference to the japanese language, how their katakana/hiragana "alphabets" are built around "a-i-u-e-o" sounds (ka-ki-ku-ke-ko, sa-shi-su-se-so) but lack any symbols for "La-li-lu-le-lo". Fortune is voiced by Yumi Tōma in the Japanese version and by Maula Gale in the English translation. In Portable Ops, Zero is arrested by the Pentagon after being convicted for the FOX unit's revolt but is exonerated afterwards.[122]. Rosemary (ローズマリー, Rōzumarī), or simply Rose (ローズ, Rōzu) for short, is Raiden's girlfriend. Meryl returns in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots as Rat Patrol Team One's commander. Raiden and Rose spend most of their conversations talking about their relationship, something based on Kojima's real life. The Cobra Unit is The Boss's personal team of military specialists and the bosses of Metal Gear Solid 3. In Metal Gear Solid 4, Solidus's brain-dead body is used, along with fellow clone Liquid Snake's remains, to reconstruct Big Boss's comatose, severely burned body to its original appearance, and later as a decoy to protect him. Emma Emmerich Danziger (エマ・エメリッヒ・ダンジガー, Ema Emerihhi Danjigā), nicknamed E.E., is an AI programmer and the stepsister of Hal Emmerich. Aleksandr Leonovitch Granin (アレクサンドル・レオノヴィッチ・グラーニン, Александр Леонович Гранин) is the director of OKB-812 (also known as the Granin Design Bureau). Raiden snipes Vamp, but before falling into the sea, Vamp fatally stabs Emma in the stomach. Sunny Emmerich (サニー・エメリッヒ) is a gifted prodigy. It is revealed that the colonel had been drinking after Gene's men took over the base and even turned the Red Army troops against him. It is later revealed that he died from his nanomachines turning off his pacemaker thanks to a virus imitating FOXDIE put in place by the Patriots. In addition, it was also involved in activities comparable to terrorism.[177]. Its setting features several soldiers with supernatural powers provided by the new advancements of science.
