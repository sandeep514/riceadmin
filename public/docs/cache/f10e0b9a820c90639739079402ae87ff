The latest on Crystal Palace transfers. Squad size: The knee injury that has kept him out for the better part of a year now is healing, and Hodgson revealed the defender is desperate to get up to speed - but the club are remaining cautious over his handling.

Michy Batshuayi to Return to Crystal Palace on Loan Returning to Palace. The 26-year-old joined Palace in 2018 but has been unable to force his way into the first-team, making his debut in this season's Carabao Cup loss to Bournemouth.
