Specifically, pandemics are the spread of a disease, unlike seasonal flus which are not considered pandemics because they develop around the world simultaneously. We Asked, You Answered. A pandemic is an epidemic that has traveled internationally. CDC’s Pandemic Intervals Framework includes the following steps: In February 2020, the WHO said it intended to stop using the term pandemic, and the organization has also stopped using the six-phase approach to classifying a pandemic. For one, they both feature -demic, which can make it difficult to suss out which word should be used in which situation. An epidemic or pandemic does not mean, though, that you should make a run on bottled water and buy all the toilet paper you can find. Some previous … You will improve your English in only 5 minutes per day, guaranteed! In 1968, an influenza A virus with two genes from avian flu strains killed nearly 100,000 Americans and 1 million people around the world. In short, a pandemic is an epidemic on a national or global level. If the spread escalates further, an epidemic can become a pandemic, which affects an even wider geographical area and a significant portion of the population becomes affected. </p> <p>A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread to multiple countries, continents, and even worldwide. An intense flu epidemic spreading across the nation has already taken a tragic toll in Michigan. An epidemicdisease is one “affecting many persons at the same time, and spreading from person to person in a locality where the disease is not permanently prevalent.” The World Health Organization (WHO) further specifies epidemicas occurring at the level of a region or community. X. A widespread endemic disease with a stable number of infected people is not a pandemic. Study Up With Our Official SCRABBLE Dictionary. Roughly 1/3 of the world’s population contracted the virus, which killed 50 million people globally, including 675,000 in the United States alone. An epidemic is the rapid spread of a disease among a given population in a short duration of time. </p> <p>Don’t panic, the teenage pregnancy epidemic is over! This period was meant to forestall the spread of the plague, which was typically carried by the rats in trade ships. Canceled vs. Cancelled: Which Is Spelled Correctly? The main difference between the Epidemic and Pandemic is that the Epidemic is the outbreak of a disease in such a way that a large geographical area is affected, whereas Pandemic is the outbreak of a disease over many countries or the whole world. Examples of past epidemics are the 1918 Spanish flu, the measles outbreak from 1981 to 1991, and a 2014 case of whooping cough. Endemic is an adjective that means natural to, native to, confined to, or widespread within a place or population of people. </p> <p>An outbreak is a “sudden breaking out or occurrence” or “eruption.” When referring to an infectious disease, an outbreak is specifically a sudden rise in cases, especially when it is only or so far affecting a relatively localized area. The National Interest has developed a terminological and etymological guide for readers to make sense of the situation.

It was the Black Plague that gave us the word “quarantine,” derived from the Italian “quarantena,” meaning “forty days.” That is the length of time that ships in fifteenth century Venice would have to wait at port before coming ashore. Examples of past pandemics are the flu pandemic of 1968, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the bubonic plague. A pandemic (from Greek πᾶν, pan, "all" and δῆμος, demos, "people") is an epidemic of an infectious disease that has spread across a large region, for instance multiple continents or worldwide, affecting a substantial number of people. AN EPIDEMIC is a disease that affects a large number of people within a community, population, or region. The prefix epi- is Greek and variously means “on, upon, near, at,” while pan-, also a Greek prefix, means “all.”.
