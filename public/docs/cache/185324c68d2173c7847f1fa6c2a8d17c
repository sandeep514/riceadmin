Cliff Booth is one of Quentin's finest-ever characters and the WWII veteran is the real hero here. Sebring’s legacy lived on in Hollywood as the inspiration for Warren Beatty’s hairdresser character in Shampoo. Sebring remained close with Tate, befriended Polanski and Frykowski, and had been involved with their mutual friend Abigail Folger.

The TV cowboy played by Timothy Olyphant really did star as one of three Lancer family gunslingers on the 1960s Western series Lancer. Despite some criticism about Margot Robbie’s lack of screen time, her portrayal of Sharon Tate has earned praise for its depth and accuracy from Tate’s own sister (who’s been outspoken about her distaste with past depictions). The actor’s company Outlier Society will produce a film based on the DC superhero. As usual, the music is one of the best parts of a Tarantino movie.

Unlike Squeaky, however, Gypsy began distancing herself from and speaking out against the Manson cult after she was released from prison in the 1970s.

Mike Moh as Bruce Lee (left) versus the real Bruce Lee (right). http://wiki.tarantino.info/index.php?title=Cliff_Booth&oldid=25113, Cliff drives a VW Karmann Ghia. Quentin is building up to a big moment when he rewrites the history book in a way that's just as outrageous as the Hitler assassination in "Inglourious Basterds."

McQueen had a persistent cough (not unlike Dalton’s) that led to a fatal mesothelioma diagnosis. Cliff encounters the Charles Manson family while Rick is filming a pilot for the (actual, real) CBS TV series "Lancer." Once again, Brad Pitt is at the center of the action when things get hairy and, this time, Cliff Booth delivers the knockout blow and changes the course of history.

The character was partly inspired by stunt legend/director Hal Needham, Gary Kent, who did stunts for a film made on Spahn Ranch, while the Manson Family was living there and Gene LeBell, a martial artist and stuntman. Here's what it says about the director, morality, and the film at hand. He's 11. He gives Manson girl Pussycat (Margaret Qualley, daughter of Andi MacDowell) a ride back to the family compound at Spahn Ranch and gives a glimpse into the dark side of the era. The world is mired in problems of our own making. In the film, we see Cliff sparring with martial arts trainer/choreographer and future movie legend Bruce Lee.
