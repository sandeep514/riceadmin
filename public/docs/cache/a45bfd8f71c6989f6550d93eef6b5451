[63] Greeks used the word Margites to describe fool and useless people, on account of the Margites. [19], Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. While in Babylon, Alexander became ill after a prolonged banquet and drinking bout, and on June 13, 323, he died at age 33. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units. Intelligence on both sides was faulty, and Alexander was already encamped by Myriandrus (near modern Ä°skenderun, Turkey) when he learned that Darius was astride his line of communications at Issus, north of Alexanderâs position (autumn 333). [265][266], Legendary accounts surround the life of Alexander the Great, many deriving from his own lifetime, probably encouraged by Alexander himself. [167][168], Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. The event marked a step in Alexanderâs progress toward Eastern absolutism, and this growing attitude found its outward expression in his use of Persian royal dress. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states. Even by Macedonian standards he was very short, though stocky and tough. [239][240] An inscription from the temple, now housed in the British Museum, declares: "King Alexander dedicated [this temple] to Athena Polias. He murdered Cleitus, one of his most-trusted commanders, in a drunken quarrel, but his excessive display of remorse led the army to pass a decree convicting Cleitus posthumously of treason. [16] Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus. The Phoenician cities Marathus and Aradus came over quietly, and Parmenio was sent ahead to secure Damascus and its rich booty, including Dariusâs war chest. [60] Alexander's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence. When news of the revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. [278] In medieval Europe, Alexander the Great was revered as a member of the Nine Worthies, a group of heroes whose lives were believed to encapsulate all the ideal qualities of chivalry. This ruthless action excited widespread horror but strengthened Alexanderâs position relative to his critics and those whom he regarded as his fatherâs men. Greek thought drew no very decided line of demarcation between god and man, for legend offered more than one example of men who, by their achievements, acquired divine status. [258] Polybius began his Histories by reminding Romans of Alexander's achievements, and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model. [16], Alexander's most immediate legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia. "[117] A similar slaughter followed at Ora. Later the incident was to contribute to the story that he was the son of Zeus and, thus, to his âdeification.â In spring 331 he returned to Tyre, appointed a Macedonian satrap for Syria, and prepared to advance into Mesopotamia. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. There was an open mutiny involving all but the royal bodyguard; but when Alexander dismissed his whole army and enrolled Persians instead, the opposition broke down. He overcame this by being personally involved in battle,[89] in the manner of a Macedonian king. [144] Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim. After a long pause due to an illness, he marched on towards Syria. Turning, Alexander found Darius drawn up along the Pinarus River. By N. G. L. Hammond, F. W.

[10] Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousand war elephants. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.

[186] At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. [128], Alexander sent much of his army to Carmania (modern southern Iran) with general Craterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus, while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the Gedrosian Desert and Makran. [262] In addition, Pliny the Elder writes about this unsuccessful plan adding that the distance was 12 kilometres (7Â 1â2Â mi), and the purpose was to cut a canal through the isthmus, so as to connect the Caystrian and Hermaean bays. Alexander pursued the defeated Persian forces for 35 miles to Arbela, but Darius escaped with his Bactrian cavalry and Greek mercenaries into Media. âI would accept,â Parmenio is reported to have said, âwere I Alexanderâ; âI too,â was the famous retort, âwere I Parmenio.â The storming of Tyre in July 332 was Alexanderâs greatest military achievement; it was attended with great carnage and the sale of the women and children into slavery. [127], Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther, but his general Coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return; the men, he said, "longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland". [60] Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. [148][157], Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy in modern times. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians. [144][175], Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. [144] Another theory is that his successors wilfully or erroneously misheard "tÃ´i KraterÃ´i"â"to Craterus", the general leading his Macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of Macedonia. Alexander immediately headed south. Mosaic of Alexander the Great discovered in the House of the Faun, Pompeii, Italy. [171][172][173] In addition, Leosthenes, also, likened the anarchy between the generals, after Alexander's death, to the blinded Cyclops "who after he had lost his eye went feeling and groping about with his hands before him, not knowing where to lay them". [144][147] The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot. [1][2] He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.[3]. [258] The Macriani, a Roman family that in the person of Macrinus briefly ascended to the imperial throne, kept images of Alexander on their persons, either on jewellery, or embroidered into their clothes. ", In 337 BC, Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, dropping her off with her brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely died soon after.
