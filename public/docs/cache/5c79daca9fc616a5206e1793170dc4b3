I was along for the ride until the last act of the movie. Most of the emotion in the film come from him, Adam Green has an almost childlike curiosity about him and made the scary parts feel more fun. You must be a registered user to use the IMDb rating plugin. On this episode The Girls are discussing ‘Scream’ and ‘Scream 2’. It also seems like an easier way to hide special effects mistakes by adding quick/shaky camera movements, or giving it a grainy look to hide imperfections. He found a doorway to their hidden world.The story itself is a little unusual. But a roll of photos the survivor took that night tells a different story. I disagree. This is also how Adam is in the movie, so it doesn’t seem so far fetched once you get to know his character. So the final scene begins with a update in which Green says the missing camera was delivered and so he proceeds to show us the creepy footage of Decker caged and screaming and then  the creepiness of one of the monsters walking through Green's house filming the couple as they sleep. Edit: As I was thinking about the ending more, I had another question. When a small town near the Arizona-Mexico border is wiped out overnight, suspicion falls on the lone survivor. Maybe because he had so much sympathy for the monsters who he thinks are simply “people that are different” . I really enjoyed it. Title: I found myself thinking of the movie for quite a while after watching it, and I came up with some theories of my own that made the ending make a little more sense. He had a son with the monster lady (who I'm guessing he fell in love with and kept locked in the closet), and the son went to the Marrow to have a better life. In closing I'd like to say that while it wasn't an outright awful film I certainly don't understand why people are expressing such high regard for this film and I hope some comments here will help me out. Adam and his crew agree to meet with him and to film a documentary, because Adam, in the Agent Mulder tradition, Wants to Believe. So we have a “found footage/documentary” style movie that doesn’t have the big budget look and most of the cast plays themselves – or maybe an alternate version of themselves. Two down and out aspiring filmmakers struggle with life, career, and the opposite sex as they attempt to make it out of the small New England town they are trapped in and into the big time. Stars Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Eddie Redmayne share their 5 reasons not to miss The Trial of the Chicago 7 on Netflix. I could be wrong but my thoughts were that Dekker was the "drunk college kid" from the story. We get our first glimpse of a freak at the 30 minute mark, and that's after some pretty intense character build-up with Decker (Ray Wise carries the movie btw). I can see where you're coming from and agree with most of what you said, but I have a feeling the 5 stars are coming from diehard Adam Green fans. Overall I liked it, but I thought some of the self-referential humor was a bit much. It did get me thinking…. ‘Vicious Fun’ looks to live up to its name, Real life horror meets supernatural evil in ‘His House’, New sci-fi thriller from Brandon Cronenberg: ‘Possessor’, The hills are alive with the ‘Sound of Violence’, Going off the grid is a hilariously bad idea in ‘Save Yourselves!’, French horror buffs rejoice! Digging Up the Marrow is a “found footage/documentary style” horror about Adam Green. I love him as an actor, but it is a "known face", so as soon as he is on screen I am reminded I am watching a movie, it just does not click with the pseudo-documentary category. On paper it would be easy to write off Adam Green's 'Digging Up the Marrow' as being shameless self-promotion and yet another forgettable entry in the redundant found-footage genre. Just watched this movie last night. Expectable. Normally these qualities would be a turn off ….but it all kind of worked. Sean Ross  Also if he was afraid them being discovered would cause them to move on, why did he try so hard to get someone to film them? Still, the movie sucks. Try not to ruin things for everyone else. Maybe what we are seeing at the end is him finishing the project for himself or to put away safely if he was too disappear or something. It was a really cool experience. It let your imagination ramp up before showing you stuff....then it walked away without giving you answers. Scenes like this added nothing to the story. R/HORROR, known as Dreadit by our subscribers is the premier horror entertainment community on Reddit. I just can;t see your average director going out of his way to spend time with a nut job. He lacked proof which made him skeptical. Ten years after the events of the original movie, Victor Crowley is mistakenly resurrected and proceeds to kill once more. It is better than some other found-footage horror movies, but it could have been way better with less self-referencing and less Adam Green cult. Choose an adventure below and discover your next favorite movie or TV show. What I don't understand is if the tape was made to intimidate Green into keeping the marrow a secret (and it obviously did scare the shit out of him) then why the hell does he show the audience the footage! Like cheap way to make something seem more frightening by adding realism to it. Though this wasn’t my favorite type of horror movie, it was very original in the way it was executed. Use the HTML below. The concept was fun. There's probably only one legit "HOLY FUCK WHAT THE FUCK" moment in the movie. I am impressed. "Digging Up The Marrow's" creature sculptor Greg Aronowitz directed the special feature documentary "Monsters Of The Marrow" that is included on the DVD and BLU-RAY release of the film.

New Friday the 13th Game Sounds..Familiar? This ‘Halloween Party’ includes pig people and… vagina spiders. I'm not some Adam Green fanboy and while I liked the Hatchet films, I absolutely loved Digging Up the Marrow, not just for the awesome story and creatures but for the thrilling sense of mystery and wonder I felt, which is something that is incredibly rare in horror/fantasy/sci-fi films this millennium. Ray Wise, who plays William Dekker, had a creepy type of charm to him. A team of Vatican investigators descend upon a church in a remote area to demystify the unusual happenings, but what they discover is more disturbing than they had first imagined.    It had a kind of found-footage Nightbreed feel, with a solid and original setup and some potential. I said earlier that I have not seen Adam Green’s other work before, but everyone involved hit the nail on the head as far as acting, and I’ll definitely be checking out his other films. Top 5 stars to me! Written, directed, produced and starring Adam Green, this one showcases the many talents of Adam Green. Note: "Digging Up the Marrow" received a limited US theatrical release on February 20, 2015 in addition to being released on VOD. Everyone involved was spot on. Nice idea and all, but pacing was way too slow and the film was dull. I found something really appealing about the film, the vibe it had that gave it the feel of a real cheap, personal project, Ed Wood style. The creepiness of Digging Up the Marrow comes from it’s feeling of realness. I liked it a lot. Digging up the Marrow is a 2014 horror film written and directed by Adam Green. It had little vfx, and a very unusual story. A search and recovery team heads into the haunted swamp to pick up the pieces, and Marybeth learns the secret to ending the voodoo curse that has left Victor Crowley haunting and terrorizing Honey Island Swamp for decades. Nor was I overly familiar with Adam Green’s previous works. I hate filmmaking being depicted in movies if it's done poorly but I think they did a pretty good job. Did he fear they would come and take him back to the marrow if they were discovered? Keep track of everything you watch; tell your friends. What to Watch if You Miss the "Game of Thrones" Cast, Sgt. Considering the parties involved, this should have been better. There was just a lot I couldn't get behind and I was so bummed because I know how excited I was for this film (along with a ton of other people. He's hardly a jerk either. the realism left. For one, he's hardly the type of character who mocks his subject or the monsters in your typical villain exaggerated way, the type that in any other cliche movie deserves a death for being a condescending asshole. It stars Green as a fictionalized version of himself who, in the process of making a documentary about monsters, is contacted by a man, played by Ray Wise, who insists that he can prove monsters are real. "-Dave"oderus urungus" Brokie. It's the closing night at the last drive-in theatre in America, and manager, Cecil Kaufman's planned to show 4 movies; films so rare, they've never been exhibited publicly on American soil, until tonight. I relate to this too. I echo the same questions. There isn’t a lot of screen time for the other characters besides Adam, Will, and Dekker, but there were a few cameos and scenes with Adam’s real crew, family, and friends. Let me start by stating that I am not a big fan of “found footage” films. Questions leaved to viewers imaginations. The Modern Horrors Podcast Episode 71: Rob Zombie Returns.
