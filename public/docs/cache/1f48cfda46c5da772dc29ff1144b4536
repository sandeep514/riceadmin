Which makes the story started with Curse of Chucky one of the best decisions the series ever made. Brad Dourif, Votes:              Child’s Play 2 acts as a sort of typical horror sequel that remakes the first film with different kills and a mostly new cast of characters.     |                Gross: The wicked humor is still present, but this installment of Don Mancini's horror franchise brings back the gravitas needed for fans to take things seriously again. Jennifer Tilly,                  38,214                 $33.24M, R Chucky (voice), Chucky (voice) / Charles Lee Ray, Tiffany, Tiffany Valentine, Tiffany / Jennifer Tilly. Jenny Agutter,  Chucky returns for revenge against Andy, the young boy who defeated him, and now a teenager living in a military academy.                 89 min Billy Boyd, Votes:     |                Gross: Chucky has been resurrected once again and seeks revenge on Andy, his former owner, who is now a teenager enrolled in military school. After the passing of her mother, a young woman in a wheelchair since birth, is forced to deal with her sister, brother-in-law, niece and their nanny as they say their goodbyes to mother. Tell us what you think about this feature. Best of all, the film brings back Alex Vincent's Andy and Jennifer Tilly's Tiffany in the service of setting up one hell of a follow-up.                  |  Jennifer Tilly,                  $32.38M, R Brad Dourif,  But something about Seed of Chucky having Jennifer Tilly facing off against her own porcelain doppelganger, and John Waters as a sleazy paparazzi trying to get the bottom of it all, makes it just weird enough to enjoy. Chucky returns to terrorize his human victim, Nica.     Stars: On the more ridiculous end of the Chucky movie scale, Seed of Chucky’s extremely meta humor came out to play in a fiercer way than any of the previous Child’s Play films had ever allowed. Cycling back to the half of the Child’s Play series that plays things a bit straighter, the first sequel in the Chucky saga saw Brad Dourif’s killer doll stalk Andy Barclay for a second time. This time, reincarnation is a family affair, as Chucky, his girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly,) and their child Glen (Billy Boyd) are all looking to jump into human hosts of their own. A new Chucky film is currently planned for release in 2014. Jeremy Sylvers,  Chucky and Tiffany are resurrected by their innocent gender-confused daughter, Glenda, and hit Hollywood, where a movie depicting the killer dolls' murder spree is underway. Also versed in Large Scale Aggressors, time travel, and Guillermo del Toro. Chris Sarandon,                   |  Brad Dourif,      Stars: Comedy, Fantasy, Horror.                 44,444 To be fair, Child's Play is the one Chucky movie you can take deadly seriously, even with some pieces of its lore not aging so well.                   |  Alex Vincent,  Many will try to outdo that first film's magical results, but Child's Play is an origin that may never be equaled, but merely complimented by a particularly excellent sequel. it isn’t long before his newly resurrected pal Chucky comes back for a third round of villainy, ready to torment Andy and an academy full of cadets that stand in his way of reincarnating himself into the body of young Ronald Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers.).                  |                   |  Horror, Thriller. Director: For a little over 30 years, and seven films, the Chucky movies have turned what started as Child’s Play into a regular Cult of Chucky.

Katherine Heigl,  Alex Vincent,  Director: Director: A single mother gives her son a much sought-after doll for his birthday, only to discover that it is possessed by the soul of a serial killer. While the film starts as a standard murder spree, involving young paraplegic Nica (Fiona Dorif) and her own series of escalating incidents involving Chucky (still played by Fiona's father Brad), Curse of Chucky turns into a film that eventually bound both sides of the Child's Play series into one cohesive whole.                  |  But when her psychiatrist introduces a new therapeutic “tool” to facilitate his patients’ group sessions — an all-too-familiar “Good Guy” doll with an innocently smiling face — a string of grisly deaths begins to plague the asylum, and Nica starts to wonder if maybe she isn’t crazy after all. The top 10 best movies from 2011, in order, The top 10 best movies from 2012, in order. John Lafia                 $28.50M, R Seeing Charles Lee Ray take the leap into his toy-bound form, and the slow unveiling of his actions throughout the first entry, is part of why the series has become such an iconic franchise. Continuing the story of poor Nica, and her incarceration in a mental health facility, the threads of her story,as well as Andy's, tie together into one frightening whole. Mixing some inside baseball humor pertaining to Hollywood into a story that follows the typical Child’s Play pattern of murder and possession might seem like a bit of a stretch, and it definitely is. The Child’s Play franchise is an unusual and wonderful creature. And it’s all thanks to a little black magic, a Good Guy doll, and some unsuspecting families that have taken Chucky in from time to time. Gerrit Graham,  Comedy, Horror. Horror, Thriller. Fiona Dourif, R When the humor is properly tempered with the right amount of edge, it works.                  |                   |  Somehow, Chucky's sense of humor, still crazy as ever, doesn't derail the series' trajectory in any way shape or form in Cult of Chucky.

Amazingly, for a seventh entry in an ongoing series, Cult of Chucky has the right tools to make this old doll new again. What little we get of Chucky in Child's Play is pretty effective, and preserves his threat as a serial killer hellbent on taking over young Andy's body and soul.     Stars:     Stars: A single mother gives her son a beloved doll for his birthday, only to discover that it is possessed by the soul of a serial killer. In terms of the more humorous half of the Chucky movies, Bride of Chucky's introduction to Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany Valentine is the proof that when done right, outrageous humor can mesh rather well with the killer darkness that the Child's Play franchise has been known to contain. Jack Bender Chucky and Tiffany are resurrected by their innocent son, Glen, and hit Hollywood, where a movie depicting the killer dolls' murder spree is underway.     Stars: We use cookies to help give you a better experience on TMDb. In time, we might even see how Mark Hamill's Chucky stacks up to Brad Dourif's original, not only in performance but also in how their cinematic universes differ. Bringing Alex Vincent and Jennifer Tilly back to the franchise again, as Andy and Tiffany respectively, Chucky now has a stable group of characters he can play with. The killer formerly known as Charles Lee Ray, and played by legendary character actor Brad Dorif, has executed a reign of terror on par with some of the best slashers in the horror genre; and it’s not hard to see why. Director: Frankly, the only reason Child's Play 3 is square at the bottom is because it’s one of the two sequels that basically remade the first film, just in a slightly re-skinned setting. Fantasy, Horror, Thriller. MGM's new Child's Play reboot will obviously take a different road than the more supernaturally inclined franchise that spawned it. All the Chucky movies ranked from best to worst, R                  |                   |               Chucky and Tiffany are resurrected by their innocent gender-confused daughter, Glenda, and hit Hollywood, where a movie depicting the killer dolls' murder spree is underway. But considering what we've got now, the Chucky movies that already exist are a solid example of a series managing to perform admirably, even in the least rewarding of circumstances.                 $17.08M, See titles to watch instantly, titles you haven't rated, etc. Meanwhile, the killer doll has some scores to settle with his old enemies, with the help of his former wife. While Curse of Chucky reinvented the Child's Play franchise as a more serious, and more cohesive whole, Cult of Chucky took that foundation and turned the series into a force to be reckoned with once more. Perrey Reeves,                   |  Horror, Thriller.     |                Gross: Don Mancini Chucky has been resurrected once again and seeks revenge on Andy, his former owner, who is now a teenager enrolled in military school.
