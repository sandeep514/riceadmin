He will be Auburn's interceptions leader next season with his six picks over the last three seasons. *Peters missed spring due to a foot injury. Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission. Our backfield is absolutely loaded. Christian Tutt is set to step in as a starter in 2019 after playing in 11 games last season and picking off a pass to go along with 25 tackles. Projected 2019 Auburn depth chart at end of fall camp Updated Aug 19, 2019; Posted Aug 19, 2019 Auburn coach Gus Malzahn gives situational instruction during practice Sunday. Auburn hasn't had a kick return for a touchdown since 2013, when both Tre Mason and Corey Grant each ran one back. Nick Coe, sophomoreRichard Jibunor, sophomore ORT.D. "I don't think you have too many [defensive linemen]," Adams said this spring. He'll learn behind Kozan this season and should be ready to take over as the starter in 2017. And while he wasn't on campus this spring, look out for 5-star defensive tackle Derrick Brown to potentially fight his way into the two-deep this offseason. First Team: Darrell Williams (Sophomore, 6'2", 234), Second Team: Richard McBryde (Redshirt Freshman, 6'1", 227). re: Auburn's Projected Football Depth Chart 2020 Posted by TheGusBus34 on 1/22/20 at 11:15 am to TheGusBus34 Have a feeling 1 of our RBs will hit the transfer portal by the end of Spring. Fellow senior Maurice Swain repped mostly with the second-team defense at nose tackle by the end of spring, but there are plenty of players who could come in and take the role. Both looked sharp, though Nix did throw an interception in the third quarter. The Arizona State grad transfer didn't drop a pass in fall camp until Auburn's second scrimmage -- and even that was due to a pass breakup by a defender. Even through the signature tough coaching of defensive line assistant Rodney Garner, Davidson finished the spring as a first-team defensive end. Follow him on Twitter @Tomas_Verde. It's tough to return from an ACL surgery. The kick returner jobs should be the same as last season, when Igbinoghene and Whitlow were the two main guys back deep, while the punt returner job is still up in the air following the departure of Ryan Davis. "[Tight ends coach Scott] Fountain said Harris, who appeared mostly on special teams during 12 games last season, was ahead in the blocking role while Rice leads at the split-5 receiver role.". He needs to step up or get passed by others behind him on the depth chart. An early stab at Auburn's depth chart for 2019. He started at strong safety for the Tigers in 10 games last season and came up with big interceptions against Louisville and Memphis. Joiner, meanwhile, provides an intriguing option in the slot while also being able to play out of the backfield as a running back. If there is a player on the roster capable of doing it, expect it to be Owen Pappoe. In this league, that's just what you have to do. Auburn missed Darius Slayton's production for most of the 2018 season. Richard Jibunor showed he might be primed for a breakout season should they need him somewhere on the field as a pass rusher. Montravius Adams elected to come back and play for the Tigers this fall instead of going to the NFL, saying he had some "unfinished business" left on the Plains. Nix might not be a dual-threat quarterback but count on him being a favorite among coaches if he learns the offense and is as committed to improvement as we expect going into the spring. Stevens has the size and the physical gifts to be an ideal vertical threat in place of the departed Ricardo Louis, but consistency was an issue for him under former position coach Dameyune Craig. This is the WFOD Living Depth Chart; a consistently updated look at the Oregon depth chart as movement occurs. 2. If the native of nearby Phenix City, Alabama, can continue to add weight and strength to his 163-pound frame in the offseason, he could see quite a bit of playing time in 2016. © 2020 Verizon Media. Jeremiah Dinson is the most versatile defensive back on the roster and you should expect him to continue to start at free safety. The South Florida native mainly lined up there as a second-teamer during spring ball and could move around this fall. Sal Cannella, senior ORMatthew Hill, sophomore ORWill Hastings, redshirt senior. *Newkirk did not participate in spring for the second straight season due to a foot injury. Tom Green is an Auburn beat reporter for Alabama Media Group. Barrett, who has finally settled in at corner and got a full spring of work at the position, will provide depth behind Davis. The primary backup for Auburn at the nickel should be sophomore Tim Irvin, who actually started Auburn's season opener last season at the position. Harrell was a bright spot on a line filled with too many questions in 2018. There were times in spring practices where Davis was the only one returning punts in special teams drills. AUBURN | With spring practice complete and summer workouts set to begin, here’s a look at how the depth chart could look heading into the summer. Auburn's sacks leader returns after missing two games in 2018 due to injury. The big story from the fullbacks this spring, though, was their use in the backfield as running backs. Auburn's top two kick returners are back after finished 48th nationally averaging 21.5 yards per return. The Australian finished 18th in the country with his punt average. You could potentially see Anthony Schwartz move over to this position or receiver George Pickens, if he makes it to campus, be a grand choice here at 6-foot-5. He'd probably be best served returning to school, but he might be hearing different things from those close to him and the NFL. If Ryan Davis can become consistent with how he handles punts, he could have a bright future in the third unit. The Texas transfer may need more time to get used to Auburn's offense before becoming a surefire starter, and Hand wants a top backup he can plug in anywhere. This spot on the field is one of the more dangerous and the Tigers have plenty of options. The quarterback competition is truly wide open heading into the spring. Willis regressed as a zone-read quarterback and it was on display once again the Music City Bowl, where he made great reads and some bad ones, too. Community Rules  apply to all content you upload or otherwise submit to this site. Britt, junior OROwen Pappoe, freshman ORZakoby McClain, redshirt freshman. Mac Jones is projected to be the holder on field goals and extra point tries, while Thomas Fletcher is the long snapper. If not, Bailey Sharp needs to step up as a senior and become a starter. Harrell carved out a spot on the second team this spring, and he's known for his agility for a 325-pound lineman. Alabama could possibly get Scott Meyer out of the transfer portal, but if he leaves, the program would need to locate someone to create depth behind Fletcher. Can he do it? 1’s depending on the opponent or game situation. The name that appeared the most behind Marcus Davis in the punt return game this spring was Ryan Davis, who has the explosiveness needed to be a top-notch special teams weapon. Luke Deal tore an anterior cruciate ligament during his first weekend on campus in December, but he should be ready to participate in practices in August. He had two catches for 21 yards. JaTarvious Whitlow will come in and share carries, but Martin will be the explosive tailback Malzahn wants to utilize. Despite Gus Malzahn downplaying Gatewood and Nix being with the first-team during the A-Day game, it’s been pretty clear throughout spring that they were going to end up as the top two in the competition. The speedy Roc Thomas had a stronger grip on the second-team running back role this spring with Kerryon Johnson recovering from shoulder surgery, but he might have a tweaked role in the offense come the spring. Chandler Cox earned most of the starts at fullback/H-back for Auburn last season as a freshman, and there's no reason to expect him to lose that job this year. Breakdown: Auburn's receivers are largely interchangeable, with most being able to play outside or inside. Auburn coach Gus Malzahn gives situational instruction during practice Sunday. It's now or never for Marquis McClain. He also led Auburn with 13.5 tackles for loss. Jack Driscoll, seniorAustin Troxell, sophomoreKameron Stutts, redshirt freshman.
