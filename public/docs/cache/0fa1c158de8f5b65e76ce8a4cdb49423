Unfortunately, that 30 minute rule was only really made for stores with smaller delivery radii and enough drivers to consistently handle the amount of business received in a given day. The employee told me that the pizza tracker doesn't actually work it's just an estimate. People were usually perfectly happy with this—unless, of course, things took longer. Swimming shorts by the door works for me. Shady as hell when it comes to store evaluations, but for customer satisfaction, we didn't have that many problems. Is the Domino's Pizza Tracker Real? Especially not if any given driver wanted to make a decent living that night. The last time I used the Dominos online tracker, it said my food arrived when it hadn't, and after about ten minutes I called the place to ask what happened. Domino's pizza made with a Gluten Free Crust is prepared in a common kitchen with the risk of gluten exposure. Or at the very least, if it did, the Tracker isn't the way you're going to find that out. The tracker updates and tells you that your order is now in the ove… Everything you need to know about and expect during, the most important election of our lifetimes, <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-the-Dominos-pizza-tracker-real/answer/Joel-Montgomery-2">Joel Montgomery - Quora</a>. That order arrives at the store. By using our Services or clicking I agree, you agree to our use of cookies. Easy. Even though we don't do the "30 minutes or it's free" rule anymore, we do still strive to have every order delivered within 30 minutes or less to ensure customer satisfaction. Just don't slow up my other deliveries by having to find the money while I stand on the porch for 10 minutes. Just like that. As others have already mentioned, there's a narrative to the tracker that the store supposedly follows: You place your order online. Why anyone chooses a chain pizzeria over a local shop is beyond my comprehension. I'd pretend to look for money for 20 minutes so my friend  1/2 mile away who's order you have in the car would get his for free under your guarantee and we'd split the difference. However, I've had it break on me before as well. Now, all that said, there are some factors that can affect your Tracker experience. Hopefully their tracker works for you! I can tell that this FWP has real life inspiration. But rest assured, unless your driver really messed up, your pizza did not get delivered to someone else. 2) The order gets through the oven, boxed, and then put on the heat racks to be bagged and sent out. It's my turn to take the next delivery, so I see there are two right now that have been placed for a campus in Oakland - both are sitting at about 8 minutes on the timer, which means they're ready to be punched out and delivered. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast, More posts from the firstworldproblems community, Continue browsing in r/firstworldproblems. The tracker updates and tells you that your order is now in the oven. Answer the door pantless. And the order itself appears on a screen at the make-line. Each order that's placed has a timer attached to it tracking the time between when it's placed and when it's marked as completed. Press J to jump to the feed. Here are some of the things that happened in our store to make it look more efficient. Under those circumstances, we usually aimed for about a 45 minutes delivery time. The tracker then updates for the final time—though, you should already know that the order's been completed based on the pizza in your hands. 3) Now I've got my four deliveries punched out on both of my driver accounts, and I'm out the door to make my deliveries. 1) The order comes in and the make-line workers immediately mark it as completed and put in the oven. The biggest problem is that because, say, Bob just got back from delivering orders and signed back in, any online order that he was delivering (as Bob) is now marked by the Tracker as having been delivered. Who give a shit? Order a medium or large pizza today and g... et another one for free. No it definitely was legit inspiration. You never got it did you? Now this is where things have a tendency to get a little hinky with the Tracker. That means, once again, that we have two options: A) We can let the timers say that the driver took a hell of  long time to complete one delivery, or B) we let the timers reflect the general amount of time it takes to make the deliveries by having drivers/managers/make-line workers still in-store sign drivers in at around the time that they should be coming back from that delivery. Once your items are out of the oven and boxed, your delivery driver packs them in the hot-bag, gathers up any other items you may have ordered (sodas, sauces, chips, etc. We would get a decent number of calls from people informing us that the Tracker told them that their pizza had been delivered, but that they didn't have anything on their table yet. And the order itself appears on a screen at the make-line. Rather, they're keyed into corporate standards. That order arrives at the store.  Since you can go back to look at the order after you've submitted it, this gave them a couple minutes time to get the order made and put in the oven, even though the tracker says it's already in the oven. The labels print out and are put on boxes. You don’t even have to leave the house. You can follow Quora on Twitter,Facebook, and Google+. This is one of my favorite firstworldproblems I have ever seen. I was really upset when I realized I couldnt watch a red bar fill up as my pizza was made. I use my dummy account to make the stats look better. Option B. The more pizza I eat, the more I expand, and my elasticated shorts expand right along with me! The person on the make-line assembles your food items and indicates that the order has been made. But just as I'm ready to punch those two deliveries out, there are another two for the same neighborhood that just got placed. Customers with gluten sensitivities should exercise judgment in consuming this pizza. Because there are a couple things going on now that aren't quite 100 percent true—but do show up a certain way on the Tracker. But the tracker and the Pulse software used in-store aren't set up to account for these individual store practices. You guessed it. Those timers and statistics are then reported for store evaluations and taken into account, along with any and all customer feedback. And don’t forget, our deliveries are all … First World Problems. The tracker is legit—but only as legit as the people in the store let it be. Therefore, Domino's DOES NOT recommend this pizza for customers with celiac disease. *Domino's Delivery Insurance program is only available to Piece of the Pie Rewards® members who report an issue with their delivery order through the form on order confirmation or in Domino's Tracker® within 16 hours of the time of purchase. ), and "punches out" the order to say that, why yes, it is out for delivery. Press question mark to learn the rest of the keyboard shortcuts. Their pizza tastes like cardboard. But since Bob had five deliveries out and three of them were under his dummy account, Fred, Bob is still finishing his last two or three deliveries. I love the fuck out of that tracker though. The labels print out and are put on boxes. By Domino's policies, for example, no driver is supposed to take more than two or three deliveries at a time (as memory serves). That's a huge radius to cover, and even with an average of at least eight to 10 drivers per night, we didn't have the ability to do our deliveries entirely by the book. I always keep a pair of sweatpants hanging on the door knob so I can put em on as the delivery guy knocks. Either that or it's just a big coincidence that the pizza tracker really was down earlier. If it's a problem you can only have if you have money we'll feel bad for you. After a set period of time—somewhere around 7 minutes, give or take—the order should be out of the oven and in the process of being boxed. Or a first world problem for the delivery guy? I worked at a store in Pittsburgh's East Liberty neighborhood that delivered to roughly half the city of Pittsburgh—including every college campus, nearly every major hospital, the Strip District, and the Homewood/Lincoln-Larimer/East Hills neighborhoods. The doorbell is your signal. As a former pizza delivery driver, I don't care if you have pants on when I bring you your pizza. The last time I used the Dominos online tracker, it said my food arrived when it hadn't, and after about ten minutes I called the place to ask what happened. So stores will sometimes fudge numbers and cut corners so their stats look better. Corporate policy is very emphatic about that. In other words, each store is eventually evaluated on these widespread, not always applicable standards. It’s Two for Tuesday time. The employee told me that the pizza tracker doesn't actually work it's just an estimate. These make a significant difference as to how a store is rated, how it's treated, and essentially, how much a store is left to its own devices and allowed to keep doing what it does without supervisors breathing down the manager's neck. So Bob may still has your order in his car (and, quite possibly, another one on his route to deliver before he gets to your house), despite the fact that the Tracker has so graciously informed you that your pizza has already been delivered. originally appeared on Quora. The fact is, there are a lot of factors that happen in a store that the tracker can't always account for, and so your mileage may vary with the online tracker for those reasons. Because delivery drivers can "game the system," so to speak.
