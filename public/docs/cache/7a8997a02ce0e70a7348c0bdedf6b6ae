The comments below have not been moderated. However, a spokesperson for Strictly Come Dancing told MailOnline at the time: 'This is pure speculation.

Dancer Derek, who along with his sister Julianne Hough lived with Shirley and her then-husband Corky Ballas as she coached them, recalled: 'She raised her hand and slapped it hard across my cheek. However, her appointment may not come as a surprise to Strictly fans - after the Latin and ballroom dancer became the favourite to replace Len last week. They said: '[Bosses] are definitely interested in Shirley and she's the only one they've wanted to have another look at, which has to be a good sign. The star, who is nicknamed the Queen of Latin, will certainly give the other judges Bruno Tonioli, Darcey Bussell and Craig Revel Horwood a run for their money on the show as one of the most decorated professional dancers in the world. Ballroom champion Gary Edwards, who went to the same dance school as Len, was also thrown into the mix, with more than 30 international titles under his belt. As yet no-one has been offered the role of Strictly's new judge. Dancer Derek, who along with his sister Julianne Hough lived with Shirley and her then-husband Corky Ballas as she coached them, recalled: 'She raised her hand and slapped it … I can't think of anyone more deserving. The British star was said to have produced the best screen test when she tried out for the role, and blew BBC producers away with how naturally she came across. Harry Styles leaves fans... Lucky Cheryl! Shirley was married to her dance partner, Corky Ballas, and the pair shared a son, Mark - who is a professional dancer on Dancing With The Stars. Shirley revealed she was 'over the moon' on Tuesday, after being chosen to take over from Len as head judge on the beloved BBC One show when it returns to screens this September. She's been a judge in the field for years.'. Derek remains close to Shirley, whose dancer son Mark Ballas is pal, and took to Instagram earlier this week to heap praise on the ballroom veteran after her Strictly appointment was announced. ', Excited: She gushed of the news: 'Strictly Come Dancing' is so loved by the British public, I have always been a massive fan. The dancer she was referring to is Helen Richey, who has judged on Dancing With The Stars for the past 15 years. I can't wait to get in to the ballroom and be part of the incredible and respected judging panel! ', Only further praising the ballroom queen, Craig then said of the news: 'Fantastic news that Shirley will be joining me and the other judges on the panel. The future of concerts?

Shirley Ballas shock favourite to replace Len Goodman as Strictly judge - years after hubby left her for former pro Kristina Rhianoff, Shirley Ballas picked for second Strictly Come Dancing audition as we reveal dancer is favourite to replace Len Goodman. Qualified: Shirley is a perfect fit for the role, as three-time British Open to the World Latin American Champion, 10-time United States Latin American Champion,and multiple-time British National Champion, Missed out: Anton Du Beke (L) and Karen Hardy (R) will no doubt be slightly disappointed, after being lined up for a spot on the judging panel earlier this year, Thrilled: However judges Darcey Bussell, Craig Revel Horwood and Bruno Tonioli (L-R) are also delighted with her appointment - calling her a 'great addition to the panel' after the news broke. It's all a little bit vague as to who was into who and who was doing what with who. However it seems the existing judges too are delighted with her appointment - despite being left devastated by Len's departure in December. 'She has a ballroom background, like Len, and BBC chiefs are keen to appoint another woman soon now that the audition list has got out. Kristina dated the U.S.-based dance teacher, nearly 20 years her senior, for five years after he coached her. An insider revealed to The Sun on Wednesday that Shirley was the only one on a list of seven potential judges to be called back for a second audition. The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline. While ballerina Darcey added: 'I look forward to meeting Shirley and welcoming her to our 'Strictly...' team. She gushed after the news broke: 'I am so excited and over the moon to have been given this wonderful opportunity. Sharing an official headshot of Shirley, he gushed: 'One of, if not the most qualified dance icons to ever grace the judging desk. End of an era: The dancer, 56, admitted she is 'over the moon' after being chosen to take over from Len Goodman as head judge on the BBC show - when it returns to screens this September. She is three-time British Open to the World Latin American Champion, 10-time United States Latin American Champion, and multiple-times British National Champion. ', New kid on the block: Her appointment may not come as a surprise to Strictly fans - after she was hotly tipped to replace Len last week (pictured with her dancer son Mark Ballas). And, if Derek Hough's revelations are anything to go by, Shirley Ballas, 56, could be quite the formidable force to deal with if any competing dancers pull a wrong move - after he met her wrath when he sneaked a cigarette into her London home. In November, Darcey revealed that Len had announced he wanted a female judge to replace him.
