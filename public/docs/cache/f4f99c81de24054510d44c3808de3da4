ICBMs typically are detectable, and the target country generally has about 30 minutes of warning, just enough time for them to launch a counter-strike of their own, making the end result a miserable nuclear shitstorm that benefits nobody–the mutually assured destruction deterrent at work. Spreading immediate gamma radiation and contaminating the area with radio active particles depending on wind patterns. Becky, Yes, someday we may discover our textbook models! And put up their land as collateral. 3 and 4 are the average H-bomb warheads used today. It turns out that the biggest problem is that the machine cannot be deactivated if something goes wrong. A number to big to imagine equaling a factor of 89,875,517,873,681,760. If it seemed that one had, the system would check to see if any communication links to the war room of the Soviet General Staff remained. So worried about some how being “used” by the periphery where even their own borrowing costs may go up without a union and while they continue to push austerity. Unlike when it was first set up, some of the new currencies would be introduced at different (lower) exchange rates. Weapons commanders in the field may be completely bypassed. Nobody knows if it is actually a Doomsday Device, that is simply a fan theory based on the fact that it really, really looks like a Doomsday Device. This is rather absurd given that I usually get the opposite criticism. First, NGDP is measured, whereas real GDP and inflation are calculated. 				Change ), You are commenting using your Facebook account. Fission ignites the hydrogen with heat which causes it to fuse leading to a secondary fusion reaction giving more mass to be plugged into the equation E=MC2. That’s not easy. The adjustments in Italy and Greece are painful, but they’re no worse than what Britain had to do in the 80s or what Germany had to do during reunification, except that the timing is poor. Unfortunately, not much better. So the 5 year collapse was not a good period for the world economy. Jim Glass,  I used the “surprise” aspect in a different post. Imagine there are hundreds of kilograms lost, instead of a couple of kilograms, because of the secondary fusion reaction. We survived and now are even being asked to help capitalize the ESF!!!

In your early posts, I unearthed a nice David Hume quote: “If the coin be locked up in chests, it is the same thing with regard to prices, as if it were annihilated.” That’s because it led to a run on the currencies of countries still on gold. I had just begun research on the relationship between cultural values and neoliberal reforms, when I got pulled back into monetary economics by the current crisis. If this sounds familiar to movies like Dr. Strangelove that’s because life is weirder than fiction. Cobalt-60 Bomb was originally theorized by physicist Leo Szilard as a H-bomb surrounded by a massive amount of  Cobalt-60. 				Change ). Radioactive particles would lose their radiation in three years as elites sat in their bunkers. The system had a network of sensors to check for seismic disturbances consistent with a nuclear strike, it could check radiation levels, it monitored communications and communication intensity on military radio frequencies, and may have been able to determine if people were still alive in various command posts. I actually used the “keeping it a secret” line in a recent comment on the Bank of England’s alleged secret NGDP targeting. Including Ireland, which foolishly bailed out bank creditors. It would immediately transfer launch authority to whoever was manning the system at that moment deep inside a protected bunker—bypassing layers and layers of normal command authority. Taken in total to any rational person all of these weapons systems represent the Doomsday Machine. No matter where it went off. This technology could destroy the entire world with weapons or save it if limitless clean energy production is achieved . To square them it is 299792458 meters a second times 299792458 meters a second. Brazil has “rescaled” the currency (devided by 1000) 4 or 5 times. The more mass lost in the reaction the bigger the explosion. On a smaller scale this weapon could make any country uninhabitable using regular H-bombs jacketed in Cobalt-60. A slightly off-center perspective on monetary problems. There are a few of insanely powerful weapons that exist … and in the wrong hands? Any thoughts? Recently I’ve been wondering about the EU’s backup plan if the euro didn’t work out. ). I have to figure out what that means. Additionally, central banks retard economic growth when energy prices increase in order to keep inflation down (as we have seen the past three years). Shrimp used lithium deuteride, LiD, which is solid at room temperature; Ivy Mike used cryogenic liquid deuterium, LD, which required elaborate cooling equipment. The heart of the system is something known as the “commanding rocket.”. ” Unfortunately, we are not just dealing with one country.”. There are also indications that more refined versions exist with much shorter half lives. This financial Goliath is the true Doomsday machine. Looser monetary policy in US would mean more growth and would have positive effects on Europe and might just drag Europe out of financial armageddon. This current structure is the worse of all worlds where each member country lacks a currency and therefore monetary control of their own economy but on the other hand the EU is not responsible for each member state’s economy the way the Fed is for the U.S. econony. A doomsday device is a hypothetical construction — usually a weapon, or collection of weapons — which could destroy all life on a planet, particularly the Earth, or destroy the planet itself. You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed. Trivia question: who can name a political, fiscal and currency union which, less than 20 years ago, split into 15 different countries with 15 different currencies? They are exactly the same. It’s hard for me to see how this ends without a bang, and so it’s hard for me to understand why the markets are not in a full blown panic at the moment. It seems to me that if they left they will see a very large loss of trade. John,  That’s easy, the Soviet Union, which wasn’t a market economy. Life on Earth would be impossible for thousands of years. You can leave a response or Trackback from your own site. I’d wonder whether the policy would last a week, before returning to the current minimize-inflation-no-matter-what policy. But things have gone way beyond just Greece. I should also say that I think Geramny least wants to leave or it is least in its benefit-whatever the sanctimoniuous German people may think-as Germany has disproportionately gained from the EU in the form of a trade surplus while most membver countries are in trade defciit. On second thought, time to cue up Vera Lynn’s “We’ll Meet Again.”. ( Log Out /  Meaning a huge amount of energy is released by the very first A-bomb in the form of heat and radiation causing a considerable blast wave about a mile in diameter. A-bomb E=MC2: Fission    Energy (E) released equals the mass lost (M) in the reaction, however small, times the speed of light squared (C). We are looking at the possibility of a complete breakup of the eurozone.

By Chris Pereira , Aron Garst , … I would think greater British representation in the ECB would probably lead to, at the very minimum, the guarantee that the ECB is the lender of last resort, and perhaps more expansionary policy (though I doubt it would be along the lines of a higher inflation target or a shift to an NGDP target). Dead Hand was a safeguard. Can You Solve Beaker Ball Balance Problem? I wonder if we would be seeing more expansionary monetary policy in the Euro if the UK had adopted the currency, given the policy the Bank of England has followed in the crisis and how Bank of England officials like Adam Posen have commented about needing more monetary stimulus for Europe. The markets seem to be hopeful, in that they’re not completely imploding, but hopeful for what? A doomsday device is a hypothetical construction — usually a weapon, or collection of weapons — which could destroy all life on a planet, particularly the Earth, or destroy the planet itself. The one true doomsday device that’s known to exist has been around since 1985 and is called Система «Периметр», or, in normal people talk, Perimeter System. This new era was ushered in with the detonation of the first fission bomb, the A-bomb, consisting of a spherical plutonium core imploded by conventional explosives to produce a breaking apart of the plutonium atoms resulting in a release of energy equal to loss of mass incurred during the reaction times the speed of light squared. That’s no longer true, so it’s much harder to devalue. They made huge fiscal errors. “Scott I don’t see how they don’t benefit it, I mean intuitively the country with the surplus is normally going to be assumed to be the one benefitting.”. (Article 63-66). Somehow, the devaluations back then were a positive for the global financial system. Becky,  Yes, or textbook models of how to boost NGDP at the zero bound. A doomsday device is a hypothetical construction—usually a weapon, or collection of weapons—which could destroy all life on a planet, particularly Earth, or destroy the planet itself, bringing “doomsday“, a term used for the end of planet Earth. Still, it’s not . The ultimate deterrence. Ram,  I wonder about that too. Copyright © 2020	 A doomsday device is a hypothetical construction — usually a weapon or weapons system — which could destroy all life on a planet, particularly Earth, or destroy the planet itself, bringing "doomsday", a term used for the end of planet Earth. An autonomous command and control system was used to determine if the counter-attack should take place, and the entire system is only even activated if a high-ranking human decides to turn it on, ideally long before the actual nuclear strike takes place. So it’s not the end of the world. Once activated, the system remains dormant until a set of criteria are met. http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/11/assorted-links-286.html. With a 2% inflation target our economies are forced to exhibit the following behaviour (assume inflation is equivalent with energy price increases): If energy prices increase less than 2% the economy is allowed to grow freely. Secrecy renders the whole point moot. A special Doomsday event sends off Fortnite Season 2 and it's all focused around the mysterious Device. Paper currency could be converted on a temporary basis by overstamping it or issuing a quickly-printed substitute (has been done). 1 and 2 are the A-bombs dropped on Japan. Even so, they’ve been done before; it’s not the end of the world. To paraphrase Machiavelli, economic reform cannot be avoided, it can only be postponed to the [relative] advantage of others. Instead of a doomsday device, Dead Hand really functions more like a strange sort of world-destroying white noise machine, calming down the reactionary people who have the ability to destroy civilization with one poorly-considered command.
