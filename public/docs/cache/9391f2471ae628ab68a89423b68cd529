April 24th start date!!! Hey J! Start Here and Join the Adventure! This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb. A story that involves the Comanche Indians, one of the world’s most legendary Texas cattlemen, Yellowstone National Park, cutting edge genetic testing, Ted Turner (yes THAT Ted Turner), one of the most spectacular (yet overlooked) state parks in all of Texas, and a charming little town named after piles of horse manure. We now have our very own stand-alone app on both platforms that’ll give you easy, direct and absolutely FREE access to all our season three episodes! Again keep up the great work and stay safe…. We met some lovely people and enjoyed time with them as well. I like Finney's acting in "The Nun Story" but not his childish behavior in this film. Miss watching, as it hasn’t been on in Virginia Beach lately? Who hasn't had a moment in their relationship where they thought to themselves about their partner, "I hate you." Ever wondered about us, and how we do what we do, how we make money, and what it’s really like traveling the world and shooting a TV show? Great to have you along for the ride! Hey guys! In flashback they recall their first meeting, memorable moments in their courtship and early wedded life, their travels through Europe, their broken vow never to have children, and their increasing tensions that led to both of them having extra-marital affairs." Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2016. It’s just the two of us and it’s important to us to keep it authentic and real! Awwww. Cutting the cord and hope we can pick it up over the air. Welcome to Two for the Road! Funny story, before we get to the pictures…Back in 2012 when our Two for the Road travel blog was still just that…, So. We are so very excited to announce that Two for the Road season three is now available anytime, from anywhere, for FREE, on some of today’s most popular platforms including Roku and Amazon Fire TV! No pun intended heh. In our ‘other’ life, we do marketing videos for dentists and orthodontists around the country. Thanks so much! We actually lived in Austin for a few years and out in Spicewood. Would really like to visit Ireland and Iceland but I am kind of stumped on how much everything costs that I see on the show. Looks like GPB is running the show now. Feel free to give us a shout. Plus we’ll be adding new items regularly. Hope to see your show on PBS soon! My husband and I are anxiously waiting for season 3 this spring, we’ve missed you guys! Transportation. In the season four premiere of Two for the Road, Nik and Dusty head out on safari across the vast, spectacular deserts of Namibia – where they explore some of the world’s largest sand dunes, see how climate change is affecting some of Namibia’s most legendary people, and go in search of one of the world’s most unique and majestic animals. [Updated April 2, 2020] Hey guys! Keep up the good work! Join us for season one of the official Two for the Road Podcast! Love checking out all your adventures,sweet life! Stanley Donen has attempted to make a film about marriage here, but as with so much of Donen's work, it remains all style and wit, with no emotional depth or psychological insight. A real period piece. It's not fair to everyone to ask me to review any Audrey Hepburn movie, because she can do no wrong, she is style elegance, humour, charm, what more to say?-oh yes the film, well it's an intelligent examination of the various stages of marriage told through flashbacks tp happy times to present difficulties.Hepburn has married Albert finned and is having fun, but as life goes on the usual strains begin to occur, witty intelligent movie, great locations in the south of France.  Automatics are more expensive but may be worth it. In flashback they recall their first meeting, memorable moments in their courtship and early wedded life, their travels through Europe, their broken vow never to have children, and their increasing tensions that led to both of them having extra-marital affairs. It’s AWESOME! But I am working on it so please stick with us. But I missed part one of the first episode of season three and joined part two just as you had come out the mine. I’m not sure if the whole state is covered but I’m happy it airs in the middle of the state. The thing is, persevere with the first ten minutes or so which has that rather sickly colour one associates with film's of the sicties, a bit Pearl and Dean, if you know what I mean, and you will be rewarded. This worked best for Donen in Charade, where his dependence on the skill, beauty, charm, grace, and comedic genius of stars Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn worked to perfection. I think this was well done and loved the clever use of flashbacks. In occupied Berlin, an army captain is torn between an ex-Nazi cafe si... An ambulance driver gets involved with a rich girl that might have a d... A shallow, provincial wife finds her relationship with her preoccupied... Bathsheba Everdine, a willful, flirtatious, young woman, unexpectedly... A private school for young girls is scandalized when one spiteful stud... "Miss World 1970: The launch of a revolution", "If it chooses you, nothing can save you. If, like me, you are watching this for the first time in forty years, you may be pleasantly surprised that the superb direction, that engages with Mancini's beautiful score from the beginning right to the very end, has lost none of its charm. A small burger with fries will run you about $20. It truly means a lot to us! We are Nikki and Dusty Green, a married couple from a couple of small Texas towns who decided several years back to quit our jobs, sell all of our stuff, and travel the world in search of adventure. And thank you so much for the kind words! I was blown away by the locations, the filming, editing, story line. Incidentally, for music buffs, I recall buying the original soundtrack, which sadly was recorded with RCA's much criticised Dynagroove technology, and it is pretty awful. Love your show; we catch it on PBS ATX. Hey Tammye! It’s a laid back Q&A talk about life, travel, Willie Nelson (the cat), 8-track cassette tapes and much more. So truly, I appreciate it. It’s official! Cheers and hope you’ll continue to follow along. Love the hand-held and drone camera work. , That’s FANTASTIC! We enjoy the fresh human perspective your show brings as you travel the world. So different from ocean cruising because there are always beautiful sights to see. Love your show. Although the room we stayed in at the Ashford Castle was very expensive. Thanks for sharing your adventures with us. From a big score while dumpster diving, to ranting about litterers, to editing their TV show, to their very first Zoom meetings – in this episode, Nik and Dusty take a break from travel…. So if you’re looking to escape with us on our adventures around the world, here’s … I guess I’ll to wait for the re-runs to those. The Official Two for the Road Podcast is Here! And thanks for watching! Listen and Learn About the Two for the Road Story! So stay tuned. Thanks so much for reaching out! We found it to be very expensive but being there on a boat made it doable for us. Hi Karen! Thanks so much for watching! And we still very much hope to be coming back to Create TV at some point as well, though we’re not sure yet if/when that’ll happen. Sign in to see videos available to you. Still not a bad deal. We are so very excited to announce that Two for the Road season three is now available anytime, from anywhere, for FREE, on some of today’s most popular platforms including Roku and Amazon Fire TV! By the way, did I hear Nikki’s distinctive voice in a tv commercial for a dentist in Durant, OK? It seems your speaking voice in the casual shots it so pleasant and the narration is an octave higher and unnatural. Yep! Unfortunately the company we went with no longer offers trips to Iceland or I’d give you the itinerary. We really love your shows, just wondering if you could get more detailed and add some prices to the stuff that you guys do. Hey Kathleen! We’ve been sort of homeless for a little bit, but now we’ve got a small ‘crash pad’ in North Texas outside of Clarendon (not here too much though). Now available for streaming anytime here on our website, or on your favorite podcasting platforms! After taking in the treasures and tastes of Nassau, Nik and Dusty board a tall ship for a barefoot adventure cruise through the beautiful Bahamas, where they come face to face with some of its most famous and fascinating residents. Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2020. Two for the Road: Sailing the Beautiful Bahamas (Full Episode), The Season Four Premiere is Here! 'Two for the Road' is currently available to rent, purchase, or stream via subscription on iTunes, Google Play, DIRECTV, Amazon, YouTube, VUDU, Redbox, Microsoft Movies & TV, and FandangoNOW . Very important y’all! It’s a quick ride, but the closest you’ll ever come to flying! Keep track of your favorite shows and movies, across all your devices. Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 7, 2020. Also are your past seasons available on Netflix or Amazon or any other streaming services? How cool is that? You can find rental cars VERY cheap in Ireland. Hope all is well and you get down to Savannah sometime soon. We’re so glad you’re here! Great to hear from you! Looking forward to season three. We had those issues when we had our YouTube channel. Namibia is absolutely spectacular isn’t it? Real people in real travel situations. We know some of it is ‘out of date’ by most standards, but we feel like if it’s not broke – why fix it! My background is definitely not in TV, so voice-over has been extremely difficult for me. An excellent watch, very good performances and acting from both. Gotta love the fuzzy kitty windshield on your shotgun mic. Directed by Stanley Donen. We’re sure glad to have you along for the ride! The really crazy thing is, what you see in the episode is just a fraction of what we experienced during our 12-day safari through Namibia with the amazing folks at Ultimate Safaris and Adventure Life. Keep up the great work, and be safe… I can’t wait to see your next show.. Hey Rob! Thanks again for the kind words about the show! But if you’ll call them and let them know you’d like to see Two for the Road, there’s a chance they’ll pick us up! Thanks so much and we just love your show! Not one character in this film is likeable, not one character HAS character: they are all shallow, self-indulgent, annoying, even contemptible people.
