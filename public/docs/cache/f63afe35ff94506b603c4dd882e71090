He exploded as a sophomore finishing with averages of 24.5 points and 10 assists per game, cementing himself as one of the top players in college basketball. This play shows how he can create a shot off of the dribble with a step back jumper: We’re not kidding. Projected top-3 picks Ja Morant and RJ Barrett also have blanks next to their measurements. 2. Morant can pull up for a jumper, or use his athleticism to get by a defender and finish around the basket, with the sophomore projected to be able to do those at a high level as a professional. Listed at 6-foot-7 and 285 pounds, he’s a generational athlete packed into the body of an NFL defensive lineman. Strengths: Dynamic athlete and playmaker, adept at creating offense for himself as well as teammates … Has ideal size for the lead guard position with a 6’3 frame and long arms … Possesses high level passing ability, even for a point guard (as evidenced by his NCAA leading 9.3 apg) … Shows great imagination to make creative passes, and seems to lead teammates into easy scores with his anticipation and vision … Plays with an edge and shows excellent competitiveness and moxie … Has a fearless style and is willing to put his body on the line and initiate contact in order to make plays … A high level athlete for a point guard with elite speed and quickness, as well as explosive leaping ability … Has great defensive upside with his long arms and great ability to move laterally … Shows a lot of leadership and determination, developing a great rapport with teammates and natural leadership skills … Very difficult to stay in front of as he puts a lot of pressure on opponents with his quickness off the dribble … Incredibly slick and polished with the ball in his hands. Marko Guduric #23. He missed four games because of back spasms, which stemmed from crashing into a cameraman after falling after a contested layup. Many of his assists did not come easy. His passing ability gets lost at times with the number of highlight dunks he has had, but he was arguably the best passer in college last season, and he should be a high level passer in the league. Morant was not ranked by most recruiting services, and although he had a promising freshman season averaging 12.7 points and 6.3 assists per game, there were not many predicting the meteoric rise in his draft stock this season. Offensively, Doumbouya is tremendous in transition due to his ball skills, athleticism and effort. In related news, Morant cracked the top 10 for Western Conference guards in the first fan returns of NBA All-Star voting, something that he said left him "speechless." Indiana’s Mr. Basketball and the No. He’s a coachable kid. With that said his three point numbers at 35.3% are not terrible, and it was an improvement up from 30.7% as a freshman, but he still is not entirely comfortable as a shooter. He would add on to that statistic in the future. Should those numbers hold up, Morant will set a franchise record for the highest scoring and assist average in a rookie season. School: Murray StatePosition: Point guardAge: 19 (turns 20 in August)Height: 6-3Weight: 175Wingspan: 6-7Max vertical: 44 in. He and Williamson grew up less than two hours apart and were teammates on the same AAU team, the South Carolina Hornets, in 2014-15. After each game, Morant has asked Jenkins to compile clips of all his bad plays and some of his good plays so they can watch. Becoming the Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year and 2018-19 NCAA assists leader is special. Averaging 12.7 points, 6.3 assists and 6.5 rebounds a game as a freshman, he obtained first-team All-Ohio Valley Conference honors and added Murray State’s second triple-double in school history. Morant isn’t just showing off his scoring (24.2 points per game), he’s doing that while ranking third nationally with 8.2 assists per contest, and even pounding the glass for 7.3 rebounds per game. 247Sports’ Evan Daniels and Josh Gershon saw him at Basketball without Borders, writing that “He’s a high level athlete who displayed an impressive motor throughout the camp. Sometimes, the Memphis Grizzlies rookie point guard meets a swarm of double teams that hopes to overwhelm him. Homepage Mock Drafts. At the same time, a number of other early stars have used this as an opportunity to move up. Doumbouya's size, length, athleticism, motor and toughness also make him a versatile defender. Morant has told Jenkins he wants to guard the NBA’s elite players so he can benefit from the learning experience. This was one year after he earned no such accolades as a freshman. In college Morant had the ball in his hands most of the game, not only creating shots on the fast break but also in the half court with a variety of moves off of the dribble. 2018/19 stats: 24.5 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 10.0 apg, 1.8 spg, 0.8 bpg, 49.9 FG% (6.3/11.3), 36.3 3PT% (1.7/4.8), 81.3 FT%. McCollum did before him. The No. It’s hard to call Porter too much of a late bloomer, as he wound up being a five-star player and the No. He's also predicted to go second In this mock draft from NCAA's Andy Katz. 28 player in the 247Sports Composite. Yuta Watanabe #18. In the third, Morant faked a pass to open up a driving lane past Clippers center Ivica Zubac. With No. Hachimura is the kind of new-age power forward teams are looking for, with the athleticism and ball-handling to take advantage of less fleet-footed types, and the strength and mobility to add defensive versatility to the mix. Other big-time performances were Morant’s 36 points in the OVC tournament championship game to clinch the Racers’ spot in March Madness and his 40-point performance against SIU-Edwardsville when he went 21-for-21 from the free throw line. 12 jersey on Saturday, Feb. 1. The Murray State Racers will retire Ja Morant's No. Dynamic and creative, Porter has started just three games so far, but is averaging 21.4 points, 6.1 rebounds and 3.1 assists per 40 minutes. Here's how No. Against the Clippers, he often absorbed physical contact anytime he drove to the basket. As a defender he could struggle early on with the increased level of talent in the NBA as opposed to the college game, however he has the measurements and physical tools that should allow him to become an effective perimeter defender as a pro. Required fields are marked *. Once seen as a high lottery pick, Grimes has taken a major dive on this board, almost out of the first round. He doesn’t get a chance to show all of it, particularly his ability to create off the bounce with Duke’s other talent, through it probably isn’t going to cost him anything, particularly when weighed against the way he’s shot the ball as a catch-and-shoot guy. He is likely to be an elite passer in the NBA. At 6-foot-3, he can play well above the rim and finish with power much like Russell Westbrook does at the NBA level. During timeouts and stoppages in play, Morant will talk with Jenkins and teammates on how to handle the offensive playbook and defensive coverages.
