About 110,000 Californians have purchased a firearm since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, including about 47,000 first-time gun owners, a survey finds. One of those clients was the Olympic swimming hero and movie character Tarzan, Johnny Weissmuller (image 2). The alleged Weissmuller link was recent news to longtime LakeElsinore resident Charles Tompkins, who said his family was friendswith the Frey family who owned the house during the ‘50s.

Down through the years, longtime Lake Elsinore residents have embraced the legend that Weissmuller had owned the ranch house property, or at the very least lived there in the 1930s or 1940s, when Lake Elsinore was a sanctuary for celebrities. And be sure to check out my other blog, The Well-Heeled Diabetic. May 2020. The rumors don’t stop there, though. So strange. Widely recognized as the definitive movie Tarzan, he was also a swimming superstar and Olympic champion long before he hit the silver screen. There seems to be quite a bit of confusion, as well as a slew of rumors, surrounding the history of the Nicolosi Estate. Joyce Hohenadl, a member of the Lake Elsinore Historical Societyand also a county historical commissioner, said the nostalgicSpanish-Southern Californian architecture of the approximately4,000-square-foot structure is one reason for preserving it. Arranged by Senator Kennedy and President Reagan, it was a singular honor for a man who was a true American Icon. In The Ultimate Hollywood Tour Book, author William A. Gordon states, “Weissmuller’s only biographer was unable to substantiate this claim, and Jeff Hyland, a prominent Beverly Hills realtor and author of The Estates of Beverly Hills, told me he believes tour guides concocted the story because ‘it sounded good.’”  According to the official Paul Revere Williams website, though, the house was indeed built for the Tarzan actor. I saw him drive down Main Street in his car,’ but that person is deceased. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.”. https://t.co/ZykYXM8M2V. Saved by Angela Allen. August 12, 1941). Williams’ design for the 8,700 square-foot pink, Italian inspired palace at 414 Saint Pierre Road included spectacular grounds with a 300-foot serpentine swimming pool that curled around the house. However, they have nophotographs or records to document the connection to the town orthe house.

To say the pool was long is an understatement. The Nicolosi Estate was commissioned by Johnny Weissmuller, who portrayed the legendary character Tarzan in twelve of the series’ films.

County reports 953 new coronavirus cases, In San Diego County, COVID-19 case rate is headed toward purple tier. Though Williams was quickly becoming known as an architect who could temper the taste of the most exuberant of clients, the interior for the home on St. Pierre illustrates how difficult that could be for the diplomatic Williams. (The Los Angeles Times often referred to it in news items as the International Garden.) Johnny Weissmuller (June 2, 1904 – January 20, 1984) was an Austro-Hungarian-born American competition swimmer, water polo player and actor.He was known for playing Edgar Rice Burroughs' ape man Tarzan in films of the 1930s and 1940s and for having one of the best competitive swimming records of the 20th century. What made the enormous, serpentine swimming pool most extraordinary was that it was kept empty. ''Rochester'' Anderson, Larry Fine (one of the Three Stooges), Herbert Marshall and Bruce Cabot also called the House their home. It may have been empty and eerie, but we put the pool to good use. That lore, plus the longevity and purportedly unique architecture of the 6,500-square-foot structure rescued it from the wrecking ball several years ago. In the book Miss O’Dell: My Hard Days and Long Nights with The Beatles, The Stones, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and the Women They Loved, author/groupie Chris O’Dell says of the house, “The grounds were equally extravagant, with a swimming pool the size of a football field, another pool made to look like a river and big enough for a rowboat, tennis courts, four pink stucco guest houses, and stately old trees with overarching branches and dense foliage. Neither the society nor city officials have been able todocument the Weissmuller connection. Perhaps most remarkable of all is that he was also a real-life hero, over the years saving numerous lives in several situations. And while I could not be more excited to celebrate the day that I pretty much spend all year waiting for, my heart is broken over the devastation to the East Coast (especially New York, one of my favorite cities in the entire world) caused by Hurricane Sandy. In fact, he was a superstar long before he became Tarzan. Some guy that looked like Clint Eastwood saw me driving by and did not wave to me as I waved to him but waved to the mailman behind me hehe. Aug 4, 2012 - No celebrity homes tour is complete without a visit to the abandoned estate in Bel Air once owned by Johnny Weissmuller, Olympic swimmer and movie Tarzan. While living at the Williams’ designed estate, Nicolosi worked on a series of bronze bas relief portraits for the peristyle Memorial Court of Honor at the Los Angeles Coliseum.

Gordon states, “Weissmuller’s only biographer was unable to substantiate this claim, and Jeff Hyland, a prominent Beverly Hills realtor and author of The Estates of Beverly Hills, told me he believes tour guides concocted the story because ‘it sounded good.’” According to the official Paul Revere Williams website, though, the house was indeed built for the Tarzan actor. Contrary to earlier assumptions, the house was not built out of adobe, which would have given it added significance. (Los Angeles Times. Then, the proponents of a sprawling residential development encompassing the house promised to refurbish it as a community center. An arched bridge crossed over the pool and led to a stone tunnel with Gothic windows. According to Wikipedia, the property, which was named a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument on April 6, 1990, is known as the Nicolosi Estate and it was designed in 1931 by Paul Revere Williams, the legendary architect who also designed Perino’s restaurant (which I blogged about here) and the residence that stood in for Wayne Manor on the Batman television series (which I blogged about here). He was the number one box-office draw internationally for ten years, and for nearly 70 years at any given moment one of his films was being aired somewhere on the planet. He also excelled as a diver, and helped to launch the nascent sports of surfing and paddleboarding. It was 301 feet long, but skinny, and winding like a snake through exotic landscaping and funhouse weirdness. He died in 1984. In spite of being declared a Historic Cultural Monument by the City of Los Angeles in 1990, the Weismuller/Nicolosi residence has been abandoned for 20+ years. “I think it does tie Lake Elsinore’s past to its future,"Councilman Thomas Buckley said. Weissmuller rose to fame in the 1920s as a world-record settingswimmer and Olympic gold medalist. Knowing how much I love me some historical properties, fellow stalker E.J., from The Movieland Directory website, recently told me about a massive Bel Air estate that had once belonged to Tarzan-actor/five-time Olympic-gold-medalist Johnny Weissmuller. Property owner representative Erik Lunde told the council hiscompany wants to keep the structure intact and see it renovated aspart of his company’s residential development project. The council’s decision came after representatives of the LakeElsinore Historical Society said the home, situated on a hilloverlooking Interstate 15 at the northern end of Main Street, wouldqualify for official designation as a historical structure becauseof its age, role in the city’s history and architecture. The Phillips family was evicted from the Nicolosi Estate after only a few short months due to non-payment of rent. An arched bridge crossed over the pool and led to a stone tunnel with Gothic windows. New Beginnings & Old Endings.
