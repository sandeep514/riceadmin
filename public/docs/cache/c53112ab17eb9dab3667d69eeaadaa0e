When Junah repeats those words at the beginning of the next round, Bagger sees his opening to offer advice. <br> <br>Junah befriends and lives amongst the local blacks, which is still somewhat taboo for those times. <br> <br>And the rules are the same regardless of the field of your activity. He has one final shot. He offers to be Junuh's caddy and help him regain his "authentic swing". He splits the prize money, saves the resort from bankruptcy, and wins back Adele. It is a subtle, spiritual skill of knowledge. A disillusioned war veteran, Captain Rannulph Junuh, reluctantly agrees to play a game of golf. Very often we are unable to see the relationship between our actions and their consequences. In fact, he is only giving overt expression to Junah's own personal convictions, and by thus expressing to them, making Junah more conscious of his own attitudes that are determining his poor performance in the match. The result leaves Junah bewildered at his own capacity, and in wonder, at Bagger’s knowledge. You can accomplish anything you want to accomplish provided you have faith in                         it, All creation is out of nothing – therefore there are no limits, This is becoming embarrassing. <br> <br>There is no one else to beat up on. Or, a wise man comes along with the knowledge and power to draw aside the curtain to help us find the hidden key. ", Junah, who had given up golf, now has a change of heart, and decides to participate in the tournament. Bagger guides Junah through his demons, through a delicate strategy of wisdom. He relives the fighting he experienced in the war. Junah’s honesty in dealing with the ball, leads to a great shot. Bagger begins to teach Junah the power of intention -- i.e. Hardy is there when Junah first arrives. Take your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat. The ego has taken over,  and even thought the inspiration behind the success was spiritual. Jones reiterates that “it's just a game.” It is another echo of Krishna in the Gita,  who indicated that we must fully be engaged in the game of life, while not being attached to the rewards. <br> <br>The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000) Plot Summary (3) A down-and-out golfer attempts to recover his game and his life with help from a mystical caddy. He quietly offers advice to Junah that has a dramatic impact on Junah’s performance. <br> <br>Explicit parallels between Pressfield's novel and the Bhagavad Gita are brought out in a book called Gita on the Green: The Mystical Tradition Behind Bagger Vance (Continuum, 2000), written by Hinduism scholar Steven Rosen with a foreword by Pressfield. He takes a high risk shot and misses. Tune in to the harmony.". Junah tries this approach, and then makes a great shot. —Stephen Hughes. Human Science is a FANDOM Lifestyle Community. "The Legend of Bagger Vance" presents profound insights into the psychology of accomplishment. The soul needs the freedom to fail in order to learn the wisdom of submission to superior knowledge. Junah meets Hardy, and the wise boy says, "Golf is the greatest game." To be in harmony with the field is to overcome that sense of separation and see the oneness of all existence and live in the harmony of that universal play. Man with a glorious potential in youth has lost confidence and faces a challenge way beyond his apparent capabilities. We can have it in every aspect of life, or here - to have the right perspective, to make the right shot, as Bobby is constantly able to do.). Junuh now hangs out with bums and is an alcoholic, as he has lost his authentic swing from 15 years ago. Psychologically devastated by the violence he had witnessed and the friends he had lost, disillusioned with the posh life he had known before the war, Junah retired to a secluded farm house where he drank and gambled with the riffraff of society and completely cut his ties with Adele and the upper class people with whom he lived earlier. <br> <br>A down-and-out golfer attempts to recover his game and his life with help from a mystical caddy. <br> <br>Hardy goes back to his place with Junah to further convince him. ), Bagger says Junah can win if he finds his “authentic swing.” This can be equated with finding one’s True Self, Soul. <br> <br>He has had faith at every point in Junah. The movie stars Will Smith, Matt Damon, Charlize Theron, Bruce McGill, and Joel Gretsch. <br> <br>Therefore they consented to the plan, provided that Adele also included one golf player from Augusta as representative of the local talent. Since he always has a smile on his face, it indicates his enjoyment – i.e. <br> <br>It is an indicator of his divinity (in this case Bagger’s spiritual capacities of knowledge and insight). During the first day of the contest, Jones and Hagen are superb. The main objective was simply to kill the enemy and survive a horrible war against great odds. Junah plays disastrously with an increasingly sullen attitude, and Bagger stands silently by, witnessing the debacle. Confidence, faith, concentration, harmony with the field, self-giving in the act, self-forgetfulness – these are the attitudes that lead to high accomplishment. <br> <br>As he aims his drive, Junah sees his eyes involuntarily drifting over to the water. 59, What is your strategy, Bagger. <br> <br>By the end of the morning, he has wiped out half the deficit that separates him from Jones and Hagen. <br> <br>The difference is that Arjuna knows the true identity and divinity of his charioteer, whereas Bagger has to wait patiently until Junah discovers the secret wisdom he has to offer, and is ready to receive it. Panic 123. Bagger tells Junah: Stop worrying about winning or losing. Stop calculating and thinking about the limitations. Bobby Jones tells Junah he has no intention of losing. It is an ultimate vote of confidence in Junah, and an ultimate selfless renunciation of any egoistic claim by the teacher, who wants no part of the credit for Junah’s accomplishment. <br> <br>"The Legend of Bagger Vance" presents profound insights into the psychology of accomplishment. "Junah" is close to "Arjuna".). Ten years later, Adele’s father died and left his daughter to manage a huge resort hotel and golf course burdened with debt and on the point of bankruptcy. Turn the hand on one side, and you are in the Truth. He reverses his attitude once again. During the Great Depression of 1931, two legends of golf, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen, compete in a 36-hole showdown.Another golfer also competes, a troubled local war hero named R. Junuh with a mentor and …  <br>At an early age Junah displayed a remarkable talent for the sport of golf, and won a national amateur championship when he was sixteen. <br> <br>Delight of Being, another, perhaps the greatest of all spiritual attributes, in that, it is in one sense, the very reason we are here on earth. <br> <br>the perfect shot. Hardy shows great courage and determination (like his determination to meet Junah at the outset when he returned from the war). The contest ends in a three way tie. Under the extreme pressure of the game and the humiliation at his self-imposed failure, Junah is finally willing to listen to ultimate truths. In frustration, he smashes a shot off into the woods and is forced to go hunting for the ball among the trees, as if he wanted to physically remove himself from the crowd’s sight. <br> <br>This is known as ‘"equality of being.”. <br> <br>The First World War starts, though, and Junuh goes to Europe to fight. The townspeople insist on having "one of their own" compete also, and Rannulph Junuh is rounded up. <br> <br>The key to success on the golf course lies in mastering his fears of failure, his sense of inferiority, his concern about what Adele or the towns people are thinking about him. <br> <br>So great the power of his sincerity, that was able to make up for the error and tie the match. Junah then hits a magnificent shot to match their scores. It is a life response for him as it allows more power to come in to convince Junah, thereby fulfilling his intention. It is Hardy that spurs Junah to provide Bagger with an opening to commence his instructions. It is Krishna speaking to Arjuna at Kurukshetera in the Bhagavad-Gita. According to the rules, he should be penalized a shot for this accident, even though the movement was insignificant. (In the Gita, one surrenders to, and therefore, has ultimate faith in the Guru, or the Divine. Telling Junah so, he communicates his childlike love of the game of golf, reminding Junah ,that like life, is only a game.
