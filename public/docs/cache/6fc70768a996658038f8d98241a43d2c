The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. God forbid! He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially. he said. Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly. Readers feel increased sympathy for the poor, as they lack sufficient shelter or clothing for these harsh conditions. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round, -- apart from the veneration due to its sacred origin, if anything belonging to it call be apart from that, -- as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-travellers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh. It was a distinguishing characteristic of Charles Dickens that he wrote about dismal subjects with a touch of humor. "You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?" ", "It isn't that," said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter self, -- "it isn't that, Spirit. They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to adoor at the back of the house. This contributes to the theme that attitudes can change drastically if only people would recognize their error and try to change hard enough. It could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this Ghost's province was the Future. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve:and stopped. "I wonder youdon't go into Parliament. Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly. "Here is a new game," said Scrooge. "Why? "Business!" When the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up. inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfishstature. I think you are. But I have made the trial inhomage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmashumour to the last. Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker's-book, went home to bed. Mrs Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigor; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of—, “God bless you, merry gentleman! But what did Scrooge care! Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. “That is no light part of my penance,” pursued the Ghost. This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people in. "Dreadful apparition, why doyou trouble me? "Much!" The snake immediately swallows up all of the staves that Pharaoh's men carried during the Plagues of Egypt. "These are but shadows of the things that have been," saidthe Ghost. Nothing could be heartier. Scrooge stopped. Serve him right. ", "Come, then," returned the nephew gaily. There was nothing very cheerfulin the climate or the town, and yet was there an air ofcheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightestsummer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain. The more hethought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavourednot to think, the more he thought. "I cannot bear it! "Why, it's Ali Baba!" When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery. He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with adeep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE. This expression, "to play the deuce with," means to have an ill affect on someone. "Why? We understand that Scrooge has all the cold, mean, and biting characteristics of winter, but none of its beauty. Into the 19th century, this word "fancy" was synonymous with "imagination" and represented a person's ability to creatively conjure images in their minds. Marley's Ghost!” and fell again. He died seven years ago, this very night. Not only has he established that Marley is dead, but he also wants readers to understand that Scrooge was the only person in Marley's life. If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart, perhaps, than they were. The office was closed in atwinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of hiswhite comforter dangling below his waist (for heboasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, inhonour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran hometo Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to playat blindman's-buff. Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it no more. ", "At this festive season of the year, Mr Scrooge," said the gentleman, taking up a pen, "it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom hecould see, but it produced an immediate effect. Were there no poor homes towhich its light would have conducted me!". And thenlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happenedthat Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediateprocess of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face. Your past. Why do you delight to torture me? As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with a chamber in the highest story of the building. such was I!”. said Mrs Cratchit. "What do you mean by coming here at this time of day? It is doomed to wander through theworld--oh, woe is me!--and witness what it cannotshare, but might have shared on earth, and turned tohappiness!". Since Scrooge is not predisposed to making jokes, this attempt at humor is likely a way for him to calm his nerves. This line provides us a further glimpse into his character. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, andivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors hadbeen scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaringup the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth hadnever known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many andmany a winter season gone. M arley was dead, to begin with. he rejoined. The leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that petrifaction of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Now it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door of this house, except that it was very large; also, that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also, that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London. Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make amends in! His body was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind. Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening the bundle, and dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.
