Larry breaks down crying hysterically while screaming in pain as if he were being burned alive by fire from an open flame torch or something similar; then all was quiet again downstairs after some time had passed—the events occurring between 1:00 pm – 6:30 pm according the author’s note at the end of Chapter 24 “The Goldfinch”. True, this has saved Hobie from bankruptcy, but it has also betrayed his trust—which is why Theo is racked by guilt. In Vegas, the house where Larry and Xandra live is barely furnished, and is surrounded by empty houses at the edge of a new development. He brings it back to his apartment and opens it up. The plan is for Theo to meet with Sascha’s men, who have the painting. Soon after, Theo runs into Boris on the streets of New York. </p> <p>Boris is similar to Theo in more than one way. At the Barbours—who live in a large apartment at Park Avenue—Theo tries to adjust to his new life. However, Bracegirdle says that Theo can’t withdraw money from the account, and that the money will need to be paid directly to the school. Eventually Theo goes, taking Xandra’s dog Popper with him. Theo becomes nervous about The Goldfinch and starts researching it on Missing Art Database. </p> <p>Shocked, Theo goes to the storage unit and unwraps the “painting” only to find it contains a high school textbook. Soon after, the two fly to Amsterdam where they meet the dealers who have the painting. Boris tells Theo to wait at the Amsterdam hotel where Theo has been staying. Boost your life and career with the best book summaries. </p> <p>Shocked by these deaths, Theo reconnects with the family and begins to date Kitsey, Andy’s younger sister. Platt takes Theo to see Mrs. Barbour, who seems weak and very sad, but is delighted to see him. He is obsessively in love with Pippa, who is living in London and dating an English man named Everett. However, they offer to pay for a hotel near their home in case he needs it. At the end of the party, Boris tells Theo that they are going away for a few days. Theo finds the shop after a lot of searching. Theo goes with social workers to a diner. He takes it to school for safekeeping. He tells Theo not to call him, but just to wait, and gives him a small bag of pure heroin to take if he wants. Boris’ father, Mr. Pavlikovsky, is also an alcoholic, and his mother is also dead. The next week, Theo goes back to Hobie’s workshop and spends more time working on furniture restoration projects with him. He must go into emergency custody because he is under 18 years old. He helps the authorities find The Goldfinch and several other paintings, and splits the reward money with Theo, who travels back to New York. They take some of Xandra’s cocaine and kiss before Theo leaves for New York City. Hobie is upset and takes some responsibility for what happened. That fate is cruel but maybe not random. Theo feels happy about the stability and joy his relationship with Kitsey brings, but overwhelmed by the size and expense of the wedding.     • Theo is now older, but he still has his head injury from when he was younger. Previous Boris is reluctant, saying that he would like more time. He is also engaged to none other than Kitsey Barbour, whom he has started to date after the death of Andy and his father due to a sailing accident. Theo and Pippa have a brief interaction at the end of the book. You'll love my new book summary product Shortform. While Xandra is unconscious, Boris and Theo go through her things and discover a stash of prescription pills along with a large amount of cocaine. Theo tells all of the details of his story and shows Hobie a picture of Welty when he was young. He runs through the gallery to look for his mother but stumbles upon the man who was walking with the girl. He has breakfast with Hobie and Pippa, who tell him that his grandparents are not fit to take care of him. A man named Hobie greets him. Theo continues going to school and learns how to restore antique furniture with help from Hobie. Theo applies to an early-college program, hoping this will allow him to stay living in New York with Hobie. The Goldfinch Introduction + Context. Theo tells Hobie about meeting Welty, who died in the attack on New York City. Audrey points out a painting called The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius, which she says is “the first painting I ever really loved.” They separate briefly, agreeing to meet up again in the museum giftshop. We recommend it to anyone who loves to read—and especially to those who prefer long books to movies, and haunting prose to special effects. He forms a connection with the other one, James “Hobie” Hobart, and is more than happy to see the red-haired girl at the antique shop once again. Theodore “Theo” Decker is merely a 13-year-old boy when his mother takes him to the New York City’s Metropolitan Museum of Art on an exhibition of Dutch masterpieces so that she can view her favorite painting: Fabritius’ “The Goldfinch.”. He leaves it in the package room of the building where he lives. He goes to Hobart & Blackwell, where he meets Welty’s partner Hobie. </p> <p>When an Indonesian man comes into the room with a gun pointed at his head, Boris draws his own gun as well. © 2020 Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Boris is relatively sorry, especially because someone else now has the painting since he used it as collateral. While there were signs of trouble for some time (Larry was taking Vicodin), it wasn’t until after he left the family when things really got bad for him; he began gambling heavily, which has become his primary source of income since then. They go to a Polish bar and spend hours catching up on years they haven’t seen each other since college. After fleeing his meeting with Boris, Theo runs into Kitsey and Tom Cable, and realizes Kitsey is having an affair. He starts to visit the Barbours and eventually proposes to Kitsey, Andy's sister, even though he's still in love with Pippa. His mother (his father’s second wife) has been dead for a while, and he too has been raised by an alcoholic father who severely beats him from time to time. In Amsterdam, Boris explains that they are going to pretend that Theo is buying the painting, but only give the sellers some of the money. Though, just like Theodore, the book’s story constantly skips between places, it revolves around the whereabouts of an exceptional painting by Rembrandt’s most gifted student, Carel Fabritius. Theo lives with his mother, Audrey, in New York City. </p> <p> from your Reading List will also remove any Well, believe it or not, it is half of the reward he has collected from the police for informing on the dealers. On top of that, Theo also has to regularly deal with Andy’s two younger siblings, Kitsey and Toddy, who resent his presence because they feel their parents are more concerned about him than them. Theo spent the next year trying to block out his old life in New York. He goes there and rings the green bell. On Christmas Eve, Larry takes Xandra and her son out to dinner on the Strip (a famous street in Las Vegas), which surprises them as he never does anything like that before. Mr. Silver comes back to Theo’s house, this time accompanied by several men, one of whom is carrying a baseball bat. </p> <p>He meets Hobie, who tells him about what Lucius has learned from Theo. Theo has dinner at the Barbours’, and notices that Kitsey watches him throughout the meal. Everything of Possibility. The man gives Theo a ring and, with his dying breath, instructs him to go to Hobart and Blackwell and ring a green bell there. Boris later takes Theo to meet his associate, Horst. Theo divulges everything to Hobie, and they decide to buy back the fake antiques in order to restore the business’ reputation and honor. “I feel I have something very serious and urgent to say to you, my non-existent reader, and I feel I should say it as urgently as if I were standing in the room with you,” Theo speaks to us at the end of his confession, before sharing a few rather bleak lessons. </p> <p>He meets Boris, whose father is also an abusive alcoholic and whose mother is also dead. After getting into trouble with his reckless friend Tom Cable, Theo has been suspended from school. </p> <p>The officer and the men enter, but they don’t find the man that they’re looking for. Hobie helps Theo go see Mr. Bracegirdle again, and they agree on having Hobie be Theo’s legal guardian until after college since no one else can look after him while his dad is in jail. Theo is stunned and horrified, and Boris is apologetic, though surprised that Theo didn’t already know this. Larry dies in a car accident, and Theo returns to New York on his own to avoid social services. He started with painkillers that he took from Xandra, and then he became addicted to Oxycontin. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:21:"the goldfinch summary";s:5:"links";s:2456:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/kyrie-irving-6-86e6ec'>Kyrie Irving 6</a>,
