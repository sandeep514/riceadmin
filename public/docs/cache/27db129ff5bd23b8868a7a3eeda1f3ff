MGS2: Schneller eure Grip Anzeige verlängern. Courtney Collins is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in Japanese and by Kari Wahlgren in English. [58], In the game of Metal Gear Solid 4, Johnny now has the nickname Akiba (アキバ) and is a member of Meryl's Rat Patrol Team 01. Come to think of it, those flamethrower guards on the mountain base area DID look a lot like The Pyro. Dr. Emmerich (エメリッヒ博士, Emerihhi Hakase), nicknamed Huey (ヒューイ, Hyūi), is a wheelchair-using scientist who was born paraplegic due to having an abnormal spine, the son of a Manhattan Project scientist, and the father of Hal Emmerich. [161] The way her name is pronounced is a play on the phrase Kojima, kami nan desu (小島、神なんです, "Kojima, he's definitely a god"). Sigint (シギント, Shiginto), real name Donald Anderson (ドナルド・アンダーソン, Donarudo Andāson), is a technical advisor later associated with DARPA. Mei Ling (.mw-parser-output ruby>rt,.mw-parser-output ruby>rtc{font-feature-settings:"ruby"1;font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output ruby.large{font-size:250%}.mw-parser-output ruby.large>rt,.mw-parser-output ruby.large>rtc{font-size:50%}美玲 (メイ・リン), Mei Rin) is a Chinese-American data analyst in charge of saving the player's progress in Metal Gear Solid. On top of his incredible agility, he also uses Stealth camouflage to make himself nearly invisible. [90] She first appears in the Tanker chapter as a member of the Gurlukovich mercenary unit and is the sole boss character in this portion of the game. Amanda does not appear in Ground Zeroes, having left to work on MSF's Cuban operations. 	Rapier The Metal Gear franchise features a large number of characters created by Hideo Kojima and designed by Yoji Shinkawa.  In the game's true ending, she is revealed to be an agent of Cipher named Pacifica Ocean. She was born and raised in a small Scandinavian hamlet known as the Devil's Village, where the residents habitually eat octopus. 	 One of Raiden's early objectives in the Plant chapter is to deactivate a series of C4 bombs planted within each of the struts surrounding the Shell 1 core. [131] Although it is set before the modern use of the word "paramedic", her codename instead comes from a portmanteau of "parachute" and "medic". Big Boss defeats her and she is thrown into the water from the force of ZEKE's explosion, although Big Boss suspected that there was a possibility that she survived. The Cobra Unit members were ordered to fight Naked Snake by The Boss, presumably with Colonel Volgin not knowing the full details behind the orders due to their only being obedient to The Boss.[8].  The unit was disbanded; however, Raiden believed himself to be in the service of a new version in Metal Gear Solid 2 under the command of a Colonel AI representation controlled by the Patriots, and Meryl Silverburgh wears FOXHOUND's shoulder sleeve insignia on her right side in Metal Gear Solid 4 while leader of Rat Patrol Team One (ラットパトロールチームワン, Ratto Patorōru Chīmu Wan) (Johnny, Ed and Akiba). [26] His name is mentioned in Metal Gear Solid 4 as the scientist who saved Raiden's life after being turned into a cyborg. Additionally, several of the characters he designs follow Kojima and the other staff's ideas. Specializing in impersonation, he even injects the blood of those he impersonates into his own body for a more "perfect" disguise. [60] Mei Ling is voiced by Houko Kuwashima in the Japanese version and by Kim Mai Guest in the English translation. [65] After defeating Screaming Mantis in Metal Gear Solid 4, the original Mantis makes an appearance, attempting to "read your mind" as before, but cannot due to the advanced systems. As Snake and Miller leave the scene, however, Emmerich finishes Skull Face off with another gunshot. Introduced during the Plant chapter portion of Metal Gear Solid 2, she is employed by the army as a data analyst, and saves the player's progress over Codec. [3] Because of the timeskip between titles, a few of the characters have been redesigned to fit in the game's year.  Because of each of the members of the unit being extremely loyal to The Boss, to the extent that they only obey her orders even when she is under the command of someone else, they are sometimes referred to as the Sons of The Boss. His predictions also seem to be susceptible to change, stating that Snake has a large place in Meryl's heart, but cannot see if their futures lie together. His name is derived from a wind condition that occurs in Southern California. He is the primary hostage Raiden is sent to rescue in the Plant chapter. The Pain (ザ・ペイン, Za Pein) has the ability to control hornets at his will, through the buzzing of a queen hornet that he keeps in his backpack. A patron to any who let their passions drive their motivations, she watches over barbarians everywhere as well as artisans, craftsmen, and bards. Jonathan is voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka in the Japanese version and by James Sie in the English translation. Liquid Snake (リキッド・スネーク, Rikiddo Sunēku), real name Eli (イーライ, Īrai), is Solid Snake's twin brother, Big Boss's second clone, and the main antagonist of Metal Gear Solid. Diese spielt sich in The Fury's Kopf ab und stellt ein Symptom dessen Posttraumatischer Belastungsstörung dar, wobei er die Ereignisse im All als Flashback wiedererlebt.   I reccomend using full automatic not shotguns. [191] In 2013, GamesRadar praised the character roles of Steven Armstrong, The Boss, Psycho Mantis and Revolver Ocelot/Liquid Ocelot, placing them in their list of 100 best villains in video games. Big Mama is voiced by Mari Natsuki in Japanese and by Lee Meriwether in English. [94] Olga Gurlukovich is voiced by Kyoko Terase in the Japanese version and by Vanessa Marshall in the English translation. Steven Armstrong (スティーヴン・アームストロング, Sutīvun Āmusutorongu) is a Colorado senator and the primary backer of both Desperado Enforcement LLC and World Marshal Inc. and the main antagonist of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. In the Japanese version, Mei Ling only quoted Chinese proverbs: she would cite the original proverb in Chinese and then explain its meaning to Snake in Japanese. However, following the mutation of the parasite, she realizes that her silence alone is not enough to prevent symptoms from spreading, and she allows herself to be captured by Soviet forces in Afghanistan. He is named in reference to the lead character of Policenauts.  The Sorrow (ザ・ソロー, Za Sorō) was a powerful spirit medium and a former member of the Cobra unit, who used his psychic powers to aid his fellow soldiers on the battlefield. [170] Venom Snake is voiced by Akio Ōtsuka in the Japanese version and Kiefer Sutherland in the English translation.[171][172].  Gurlukovich was also the one who provided a Hind-D helicopter to Liquid Snake in Metal Gear Solid with a possible usage of Metal Gear REX. Emmerich is accused by Diamond Dogs of murdering Strangelove and facilitating the attack on MSF for Cipher in exchange for his own safety, and is later found guilty of triggering a deadly new mutation in the vocal cord parasites that results in Venom Snake being forced to execute his own men and prevent them from escaping into the world. Gene's defeat results in Snake being given data with resources/personnel. Emma and Hal became very close as children and often swam together. First appearing in the original Metal Gear games, he goes missing during the original game with his last transmission being a cryptic message simply saying "Metal Gear",[24] and returns as an enemy in Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. She is a central character in the radio drama version of Metal Gear Solid (set after the events of the original game) and appears in the Game Boy Color version of Metal Gear Solid (a side story not clearly related to the main series). Per The Boss's will, Snake conceptualized MSF as capable of providing combat support to any individual or country, regardless of other factors. The CIA uses him as a counterpart to Snake in case he rebelled. [47], Johan Jacobsen (ヨハン・ヤコブセン, Yohan Yakobusen), named Yozev Norden (ヨゼフ・ノルデン, Yozefu Noruden) in the MSX2 version, is a zoologist specializing in the preservation of all endangered species. After learning of her survival, Big Boss is sent to retrieve her and Chico from the camp, believing her to be instrumental in finding and stopping Cipher. An officer in Russia's Spetsnaz and GRU, he leads his personal team of mercenaries to seize the Discovery during the Tanker chapter of Metal Gear Solid 2 for the purpose of hijacking Metal Gear RAY. She takes over her father's unit after her father's death in the Tanker chapter, lending her team to Solidus Snake's Sons of Liberty terrorist faction. Big Boss ultimately succeeds, however, in stopping the false data from being sent. [111] During the Plant chapter of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, she is in charge of developing the AI that controls Arsenal Gear. Solid Snake (ソリッド・スネーク, Soriddo Sunēku) is the primary character of the original series. Rosemary (ローズマリー, Rōzumarī), or simply Rose (ローズ, Rōzu) for short, is Raiden's girlfriend.  [103] After Naomi Hunter designs a syringe used to destabilize the functionality of nanomachines, a wounded Vamp uses it to end his suffering. [159] Huey remains with Big Boss and MSF during Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, working to hide MSF's nuclear capabilities from the United Nations. This is only remedied when The Boss supposedly defects over to the communist faction. He eventually became a spy and assassin apparently specializing in poisons, killing Joseph Stalin in revenge for the subjugation of Romania. The character's likeness was provided by Lyndall Jarvis. [109] However, Fortune manages to psychically deflect Ocelot's attacks from Metal Gear RAY before dying, with Snake hinting that her power as "Lady Luck" was not completely fake. I'm completely insane! 	 	5th edition rules Vulcan Raven (バルカン・レイブン, Barukanreibun) is an Inuit member of FOXHOUND who wields a giant Vulcan cannon and has shamanic powers of intuition seen in Metal Gear Solid. After the final battle, Raiden is reunited with the real Rose, pregnant with his child, in front of Federal Hall National Memorial. The Pain is voiced by Hisao Egawa in the Japanese version and by Gregg Berger in the English translation. When Zanzibar Land declared themselves a nuclear power thanks to Metal Gear D, Solid Snake infiltrates Zanzibar and discovers the nation's benefactor is Big Boss, and defeats both Metal Gear and Big Boss. As the commander of XOF, he authorizes and participates in the torture and imprisonment of Paz and Chico, and later leads an assault against Big Boss's Mother Base, which results in the Militaires Sans Frontières' partial destruction. Jim Houseman (ジム・ハウスマン, Jimu Hausuman) is the United States Secretary of Defense who observes the situation on Shadow Moses Island aboard an AWACS command plane. The Philosophers (賢者達, Kenjatachi) was an inner circle of 12 people (known as The Wisemen's Committee (賢人会議, Kenjin Kaigi)) which was formed at the end of World War I when the leaders of the United States, China and Bolshevik Russia entered a secret pact with a stated purpose of pooling money to rebuild countries affected by the war. Militaires Sans Frontieres (国境なき軍隊, Kokkyō Naki Guntai, translated as "Soldiers Without Borders") is Naked Snake's mercenary group in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.
