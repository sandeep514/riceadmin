During the robbery, Lev takes a fancy pen from a well-dressed bank customer who tells Lev he is making a terrible mistake.  Everybody kept saying we shot like TV because we only had 31 or 32 days of filming, which is insane. I wanted a physical narrative that gives you geography to work across. Development on the project began in November 2016, when it was announced Jodie Foster would star in the film with a script to be written and directed by Drew Pearce. It stars Jodie Foster, Sterling K. Brown, Sofia Boutella, Jeff Goldblum, Charlie Day, Brian Tyree Henry, Jenny Slate, Dave Bautista, and Zachary Quinto. Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2018. Variety Add those to a high end cast, and what you have here is a pretty cool movie that's worth the pourchase. I can appreciate why people didn’t like this movie. I just think he was well prepared, and even if he was nervous he didn’t put any stress on us for sure. They keep coming, huh?
