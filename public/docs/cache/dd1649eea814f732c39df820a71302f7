Sounds simple enough, but “The Driller Killer” is just a cut above most other grisly slasher films from its time. Obviously not a film for humorless anti-feminists, this exploitation film mixes its exaggerated politics with more nuanced and even morally questionable complexity in its individual scenes. For the addict, addiction is an immediate and present concern, but by invoking the vampire mythology’s obsession with history, Ferrara crafts a carefully deliberated dialectic of substance abuse, covering everything from the nature of evil to the cult of sobriety. Subscribe now for exclusive offers and the best of cinema. He is helped out by his brother, Johnie (Matthew Modine), as well as The Baron (Bob Hoskins), who tries desperately to get people into the club (and keep them there), but there’s the looming presence of Lillian (Sylvia Miles), who wants to reconvert the club if (or when) it becomes unprofitable. By the time the film has come to a finish, you’ll probably feel like you’re going to die as well. “The Funeral” takes on the traditional revenge notion with its use of dual narratives, one showing the aftermath of Jonny’s (Vincent Gallo) murder and the mourning from his family and friends, and the other showing his life and the events leading up to his demise. Ferrara described this as his first “intentional comedy” and it’s debatable as to whether it’s his funniest film, but amidst the chaos and disorganization of the club, there is some hilarity to be seen, especially Ray’s penultimate scene when he tries introducing his performers whilst trying almost successfully to subdue his frustrations from flailing out. It focuses mostly on Cisco (Willem Dafoe) and Skye (Shannon Leigh, Ferrara’s then girlfriend) as they keep to themselves in their loft and wait for the end in whichever way they can – by creating art, tuning in to online end-of-the-world sermons, sending farewells to loved ones over Skype, ordering Chinese food, and occasionally going outside and collapsing under the anxious existential pressure. It is clear that a comprehensive critical rehabilitation is long overdue.                            2:00 PM PDT Willem Dafoe plays an artist facing his final 24 hours before the world ends. While they are initially pitted against each other – a recurring motif sees the lieutenant betting on the Dodgers, the team that would eventually leave Brooklyn for Los Angeles – it becomes apparent that Harvey Keitel’s titular cop will become a conduit of New York’s salvation. The rape-revenge arc and hard-boiled title may root Ms. 45 in the exploitation tradition, but Ferrara’s vision is far more audacious. ©2020 British Film Institute. After getting such a kick out of this, she decides to take to the streets on a murderous rampage, taking out the likes of aggressive pimps, wealthy chauvinistic businessmen, gang members, and an assortment of other rowdy men, all the while confiding silently to herself that she is justified in her actions. Cette année-là, sa carrière commence vraiment avec son film d'horreur Driller Killer, qui, remarqué par William Friedkin, lui offre la possibilité de tourner son deuxième film, L'Ange de la vengeance, av… Much of Ferrara’s American output in the 21st century has considered the essence of New York post-Giuliani. Biography: Independent New York filmmaker Abel Ferrara became best-known for his low … Abel Ferrara, 2008. Il commence en réalisant des films amateurs en Super 8 sous le pseudonyme de Jimmy Boy L. jusqu'en 1979. In this sense, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken are the embodiments of the 90s Ferrara aesthetic. The best examples filter the director’s thematic concerns through performances of unhinged grandeur. The subsequent films consider what was lost in the process – the answer is Ferrara’s city. It is one of the very few post-New Hollywood mainstream films to replicate that movement’s nihilistic bent with such bruising authenticity. This is one worth watching if you can vibe with the exploitation manner. A contemplative William Gibson adaptation that betrays a wariness of what is to come, New Rose Hotel is a fitting coda to his remarkable work during the decade. With a poster as raunchy as this one, you’d be mistaken to think this was a sleazy throwaway kind of film, but it actually uses the sleaziness that’s inherent with the strip club setting of this one-setting film to show us the comically disastrous inner workings of one of the many gentlemen’s clubs in Manhattan. ), young Tony (James Russo) develops a relationship with Tye (Sari Chang), though pressure comes on top of them as both of their older brothers begin a gang rivalry that escalates in its conflict and violence, with both gang members disapproving of this blossoming and powerful romance. Ferrara riffs on the idea of an actor martyred for her director’s vision by slipping seamlessly between text and the text within it. Gallo does well with his character, though it’s the performances of the brothers that make this film so special. “Cat Chaser” moves at a very comfortable pace, with the pleasing and easy-going (yet undoubtedly stylish) mise en scene, making the story easier to digest as it seems each line of dialogue is used to establish the plot. It’s a monumental achievement on his part – a brooding, self-reflexive masterpiece, mournful of what is lost, but strangely serene about the exit state. Penn is clearly more aggressive, showing someone who, unlike the calculating Ray, is more prone to emotional impulses; Penn picked up the Best Supporting Actor award when this film played at the Venice Film Festival. This isn’t one of Ferrara’s more experimental or unpredictable films, but it’s one with a consummate professionalism in its craft (from the screenplay to the acting to editing) that makes it a strong crime film of the 90s. News, features and opinion on the world of film. Zoe Lund plays Thana, the picture’s avenging angel, exacting random and violent retribution on the men of New York. In the late 2000s, Ferrara made three documentaries in quick succession – Chelsea on the Rocks (2008), Napoli Napoli Napoli (2009) and Mulberry St. There’s Roland Emmerich’s bombastic “2012”, but for a much more introspective and low-key vision, Ferrara’s film is about an entire planet awaiting its ultimate demise. A prolific independent filmmaker with a penchant for graphic sex and violence, director Abel … Registered charity 287780. While the last 15 years have seen Ferrara produce some of the best work of his career, his latest film, Pasolini, will only be the second of his pictures to get a UK theatrical release during that period. It works as a counterpoint to Martin Scorsese’s Italianamerican (1974) – Scorsese’s is a story of transition from Italy to America, whereas Ferrara’s is a transition from one kind of city to another.                        on Fear City would become a blueprint for many of his later films, serving as the stylistic foundation for pictures as disparate as glossy folly Cat Chaser (1989) and fin-de-siècle marvel ’R-Xmas (2001). It is a de-eroticised ritual of power that is brilliantly reversed as he falls prey to the US justice system – one beast at the mercy of another. In his rather immense filmography, he’s produced a few amiable duds, but they are dwarfed by the best work he’s created, and the exciting thing is there’s no clear timeline for when he was great – his best work is spread out all over his career. It’s a revealing, self-critical insight into his process. 4:44 Last Day on Earth closes the cycle by bringing the apocalypse to New York. This is yet another example of Ferrara letting the acting do the talking, using what is admittedly a conventional crime story to let actors like Walken and Penn take center stage and really show their acting chops. The reason for Reno’s insanity is that he’s been finding it difficult to work on the mural he has been commissioned to paint due to the noisy band that moved in next door to his apartment.                        IFC (125), Tue, Oct 20 Based on former IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s arrest for the sexual assault of a Manhattan hotel chambermaid in 2011, Welcome to New York is a vivid, animalistic expression of the rotten heart of modern white-collar masculinity. 1. Abel Ferrara, Director: Bad Lieutenant. An anchor in a tempest, he dictates the picture’s shape. Lund’s tragic real-life trajectory is a key extratextual factor in the narrative of Ferrara’s art – the horrors of addiction are evident in the dichotomy between the youthful ingénue in Ms. 45 and the ravaged woman shooting up in Bad Lieutenant (which she also co-wrote) a decade later. All rights reserved. It’s not a serious film and doesn’t have the dramatic weight of Ferrara’s later efforts, but it’s guided by a pretty mesmerizing performance from Lund, who gives one of the great silent performances outside of the silent era. The astonishing final act sees the film closing in on itself, becoming a fatalistic treatise on evil, culpability and performance.

Born in the Bronx, Ferrara started making amateur films on Super 8 in his teens before making his debut with violent exploitation films such as 'Driller Killer' and 'Ms.45'. He ends up wooing Mary (Kelly McGillis) instead and hatches a plan with fellow veteran Nolen (Frederic Forrest), and the slimy yet efficient former policeman Jiggs (Charles Durning) to rip off Mary’s husband for $2 million. But as revenge films tend to be, she goes too far with her vengeance. Going from a slasher film to femsploitation, he cast the 17-year-old Zoe Lund as the mute, introverted, and timid Thana, a fashion seamstress who is raped twice after leaving work one day, who manages to attack her second assailant and keep his .45 handgun.
