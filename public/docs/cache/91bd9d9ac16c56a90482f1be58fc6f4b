Phelps already has a sequel in the works with ideas for a trilogy. These signed papers were subsequently used to print their "contracts".

Also, if the returnees (all of whom endured immense trauma in near captive conditions), in expressing their grievances, had violated the sanctity of the embassy premises, why were they not reported to the local authorities? The above narrative clearly establishes that returnees from Vietnam are survivors of trafficking.
