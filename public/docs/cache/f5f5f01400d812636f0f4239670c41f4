Falco initially scores the apparent winning touchdown, but it's called back on a Sentinels penalty. She appears to play the role of the ditzy blonde that always forgets things and spaces out. With O'Neil accepting his requests, McGinty builds his team of different varying players that he believes can make a winning team.                      When Falco stands up to Martel, a brawl follows, leading to the replacements being arrested, but they build a bond in the process, dancing together to the Gloria Gaynor song "I Will Survive" in their cell before McGinty bails them out. The supporting cast, from Orlando Jones to Jon Favreau, Rhys Ifans, and the great Gene Hackman, all come together to really make this movie a lot of fun.

It is not going to go down as the greatest sports movie ever nor the greatest comedy ever. Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 16, 2008, I bought this because of previous reviews. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. However, since Shane Falco was the one who fumbled the ball at the start of the play and is the only one who advances it, the play would have been legal in real life. However, Gruff spots bookies that he owes money to in the crowd, and realizes that they want him to throw the game or they'll take his pub from him as compensation. One of the best of its type. This movie, to quote a line "has heart". Brooke Langton plays Annabelle, the head cheerleader who grows increasingly fed up by the audition montage. It eventually grossed $44.7 million domestically and $5.3 million internationally to over $50 million worldwide. Somewhat predictable but who wants to watch a movie in which the people with second chances lose?  In the same scene, the announcers indicate that after recovering the onside kick, the Sentinels needed to call a timeout. The Replacements stars Keanu Reeves as Shane Falco, a former all-star college quarterback who dropped off the radar after a disastrous game. Will not tell you more as may spoil your enjoyment if you buy it, which you should and give yourself a treat. Falco celebrates with Annabelle, while McGinty narrates that the replacement players left the field with nothing but the satisfaction and personal glory of what they've accomplished, which is living the athlete's dream of a "second chance." The replacements' first game is against Detroit, and the team initially struggles to get along, causing the Sentinels to fall behind early. Then there are the cheerleaders, who apparently walked too (that part is never fully explained but this movie is too charmingly silly to take it to task). We know life happens, so if something comes up, you can return or exchange your tickets up until the posted showtime. Here, he actually shows a bit of acting ability, unlike his earlier efforts (Bill & Ted, for example, or even the Matrix). McGinty tells the replacements that the strike will officially end the next day, giving the players incentive to give everything they have left. The soundtrack is really excellent and the quality of the DVD is fairly remarkable too. Enter your location to see which The swearing means it will not be ok for the family to watch, not under twelves certainly. He then watches the replacements dance on the field as they did earlier in the movie. The multiple-fumble touchdown for the Sentinels against the Phoenix team was based on the real-life Holy Roller between the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers in 1978. In the first half of the final crucial game, Martel clashes severely with the replacement players, and also smugly ignores any play calls McGinty makes, causing the Sentinels fall behind to Dallas 17–0. [5] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale.

Rack up 500 points and you'll score a $5 reward for more movies.                  The website's critical consensus states: "The clichéd characters and obvious outcome make all the fun and excitement amount to nothing. Even those only mildly interested in football ought to be able to enjoy this great feel good movie about second chances. There are multiple other instances in the film where typical football rules and strategy are inaccurate. After several players attempt to literally answer the question, Falco uses the metaphorical answer of "quicksand", leading the players to realize they're all afraid of failing in their second chance at football. On the way to the locker room for halftime, McGinty tells a TV reporter that the team needs "heart" to come back and win, something he had earlier said Falco had.
