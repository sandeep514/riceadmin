It’s always going to be capitalism first.”, Politically, Monáe’s beliefs fall right in line with the ethos of Homecoming, which was created by Micah Bloomberg and Eli Horowitz, who adapted their Gimlet Media podcast of the same name. Real cosmic shit. It’s always going to be power first. In previous interviews she said the roles she takes on in her music and on film tell parts of her story and her part in the larger experience of being a queer black woman in America. This is as true of 2013's "Electric Lady" and 2018's "Dirty Computer," whose accompanying film is a celebration of pansexuality and the female form, as it is of her work in the 2016 Oscar nominated films "Hidden Figures" and eventual Best Picture winner "Moonlight.". “I feel a deeper responsibility because I know there are kids like me who could have come from conservative backgrounds,” she says. “Staying at home for me is different than staying at home and not working for a mom with five kids, when she’s single and can’t afford to pay her rent or pay for food for her kids.”. ", As for where her "Homecoming" heroine fits into the story of who she is, Monae thinks for a moment before answering, "Both of us are trying to figure out what is really going on in our world, you know? “We can’t trust this administration to tell us the truth, to protect us. Janelle Monáe’s voice flows like a sound bath calibrated to induce hypnosis. She's being manipulated, and I feel like we're all getting manipulated every single day.". “I have an orange,” she starts, after careful, Cheshire cat-like consideration. Sorry, you have Javascript Disabled! The Sedona Vortexes—which, until now, I did not know existed—are “swirling centers of energy that are conducive to healing, meditation, and self-exploration,” per the town’s tourism board. There will be a vaccine—and a future. This teaser is captioned as, “Janelle Monae stars in Homecoming. “I’m ready to go to a party,” she says insistently. “A party where we are sweating, we are smiling, we are dancing for our souls.”, HAIR DIRECTION BY NIKKI NELMS; MAKEUP DIRECTION BY JESSICA SMALLS; SPECIAL THANKS TO BRENT ADAMS, JOSH DEAN, Monáe, who’s 34, has protected her mystique from the beginning of her career, even when she was an unknown singing on the steps of Atlanta college libraries for free, before Diddy signed her to a remarkably hands-off deal with Bad Boy Records in 2008 and jump-started her mainstream career. From the awards race to the box office, with everything in between: get the entertainment industry's must-read newsletter. Before signing on to star in "Homecoming," Monae listened to series creators Micah Bloomberg and Eli Horowitz's podcast and watched the first season, "which had this kind of Hitchcockian vibe to it," she said. Her polymathic approach to art extends beyond recording studios and film sets. Monáe was drawn to the movie because she’s a fan of Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained—one of her musical alter egos is the unapologetic “Django Jane”—and Antebellum wound up being shot at Louisiana’s Evergreen Plantation, where parts of that movie were filmed. “I loved it because it was just a reflection of where I am now,” she says. There was a moment where I did break down and cry. “This kind of show is not for the faint of heart and the workload is Herculean. She is an incandescent talent.”, Monáe, a warm Midwesterner at heart, was raised in Kansas City, Kansas, by Baptist working-class parents. I had to, because she’s using a digital background that sets her floating above the Golden Gate Bridge, hovering near the slope of one of its spindly tentacles, surrounded by water on all sides. Her skin is glowing, despite the fact that she’s still recovering from a bout of mercury poisoning diagnosed last year. Monáe and I are, of course, talking to each other over Zoom, the video-chat platform that became indispensable when the coronavirus began its rampage. She spent years crafting concept albums about apocalyptic robots and black, queer, Afro-futuristic revolution, often performing as her android alter ego, Cindi Mayweather. ------------------------------------------. Janelle Monae is a talented Actress and singer who will play the lead role in the second season. Reproduction of material from any Salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited. Janelle Monáe: Artist in Residence. As for her promotion of "Homecoming," when I connected with Monae on Zoom as part of a recent virtual media event, she greeted me from a reclined position that read as exhaustion. News & Updates, Rookie Historian Goo Hae-Ryung Season 2: When Will It Return? Monáe declines to get specific about her own love life, which is rumored to have included famous and talented women, such as Tessa Thompson, whom Monáe cast to play her lover in the accompanying film (or “emotion picture,” in Wondaland parlance) for her last album, Dirty Computer. She’s wrapped the photo shoot for this issue and mentions that she kept the braids for the pictures. Monáe doesn’t want to share where she is partly because the place you’re sheltering becomes exponentially more important when you’re going to be there indefinitely. “Homecoming” Season 2 opens with Janelle Monáe in a boat — so far so good! And I think we're experiencing that right now," she said. It’s not about where she is—it’s about where she’s decided to take me. “She really went inward,” says Gerard Bush, who wrote and directed the movie with Christopher Renz. The eight-time Grammy nominee, style icon, and Prince protégé speaks from quarantine about fear, fury, and her hope for “a real uprising.”. Artful obfuscation is part of Monáe’s appeal. When she read the new scripts, she was quick to say yes. . Follow her on Twitter: @McTelevision. she added later. Monáe has spent some time driving around lately, observing people in masks, taking in the state of our world. Billy Porter met Monáe under much more glamorous circumstances, when she asked him to perform with her at the Oscars earlier this year. And they also poison us," she said. Everybody puts their guards down because you feel so balanced.” She and Monáe bonded fast: “We’re mirror reflections of one another when it comes to the way we create. The movie may divide viewers, but Monáe is transfixing. I just thought that they're innovating in this TV world.". Retracing her steps—and crossing paths with shrewd Audrey (played by the brilliant Hong Chau)—she begins to decipher the truth. I hate that that's the case. “I’m happy that he is recovered, but what that left me with growing up was having abandonment issues, because I just never knew when he would show up. Monáe’s social conscience led her to sign on for Antebellum, too. Their stories illustrate two of the best ways you could ever meet anyone and capture Monáe in different modes. Looking for more? Monáe is tireless when it comes to talking politics. We should keep this in mind that Roberts had only one season deal for the series. They did. . Monáe is quick to ask me about my own family and self-isolation, sneaking multiple questions under the trench coat of a single burst: “How are you? I’ll have to figure out different ways to financially support myself. We will see Stephan James as Walter Cruz, Chris Cooper as Leonard Geist, Joan Cusack as Francine Bunda, and many others. “As an activist, she uses her platform to lift up countless communities,” says Obama.

She is currently working with the Sevakalp Foundation. A goal oriented woman who is living life gloriously! Monáe is one of those rare people with perfectly symmetrical features, a possessor of almost algorithmic beauty. Highly focused towards her aim, she inspires many others. . “We were just all really sober-minded and clear and pure. Monae's work is steeped in a dedication to civil rights, queer identity, and feminism, all elements that "Homecoming" enables her to uplift and, with regard to patriarchal expectations placed on women struggling to succeed under a corporate structure, to critique.
