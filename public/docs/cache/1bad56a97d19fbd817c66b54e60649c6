English outlet Mirror has reported that Liverpool have made contact with Barcelona over the possibility of signing Ousmane Dembele in a loan deal. Gomez, in particular, can shoot and pass with either foot, making him a nightmare for defenders. Atalanta quickly looked for a goal that would give them peace of mind.

Taken from Wyscout. Just click the "Edit page" button at the bottom of the page Atalanta Tactics Explained (2020) Release Info.  The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Gian Piero Gasperini’s excellent tactical setup has created a multifaceted young team that can play in different styles and have plenty of ways to create chances and score goals. I'm shattered, I can't believe it. It looks like we don't have any Cast and Crew for this title yet. Palomino made 21 recoveries and won 21 of his 30 duels (defending and aerials). They played for several moments of the match with a 4-4-2 system. When they played Napoli, however, they had a different approach however. Both strikers combined well with Sensi’s help from behind who helped to drag players out of position. This was one of the matches that determined a place in the European Cups, as Atalanta had the opportunity to make history. Sassuolo, for their part, took to the pitch with a 4-3-3 formation. Duncan left his position as an interior midfielder and went on to play as a striker between Locatelli and Berardi. Papu is the most talented #10 in Serie A. Gomez is the best attacker in Serie A. Interestingly, Atalanta almost exclusively cross the ball low or cut inside. Ball is played into a wide area from where a cross is delivered into Freuler who scores beautifully. Write CSS OR LESS and hit save. Below is another video of a strong switch of play from left to right which leads to a goal. Kessie is also certain to move in the summer.  Official Sites The defensive shape can be seen below. Inter would always aim to win the ball back and apply intense pressure on the ball carrier, although they would lose possession quite easily too.

Atalanta and Sassuolo faced two different realities. In front of him was a three-man backline consisted of Alessandro Bastoni, Stefan de Vrij and Diego Godín. Shared Share with; Share with; Brozović would be the one to press Pašalić and Iličić to trouble the build-up. Lukaku was extremely quick switching to attacking actions, especially after defending set-pieces. Also note the way the centre backs leave the defensive line to mark their closest opponent, further highlighting their man-marking approach. Atalanta are also confident in tight spaces where they quickly combine to get out of pressure. This, of course, is no coincidence. The Premier League is famous for its lavish spending on player’s transfers. This box midfield creates further problems for the opposition as the midfielders will have two Atalanta players in front of them as well as two behind them. Next season will be Atalanta’s biggest yet in their 112-year history after booking a place in the Champions League and we can expect great things from Gasperini and his Atalanta side. Atalanta often look to overload around the ball to attract opposition to one side before quickly switching sides. The attacking setup is almost complete and coupled with the energy and intensity the team presses and defends with Gasperini has created a terrific young side. The overlapping runs from Spinazzola outside of Gomez has helped the Argentine as Spinazzola attracts attention from defenders with his pacy runs from deep. Atalanta’s wide forward players would constantly move all over the opposition half. The 3-4-3 shape means the wing backs, most often Andrea Conti and Leonardo Spinazzola, naturally provide width down both sides with the attacking midfielders Kurtic and Gomez positioned in either half-space. They also have a better record (57.69%) when it comes to winning aerials duels, which affected their defensive performance.     |                         When Atalanta tried to exploit either of the wings, the central-backs would partner with the wing-backs and cover the players out wide getting the support of one of the central midfielders. In addition, Atalanta also attempted attacks from the right side with crosses. When in defensive transition were joined by the wing-backs in the game Cristiano Biraghi and Antonio Candreva. Both exchanged positions during several passages of the match and were a tandem that worked perfectly. If the players are not in peak physical and mental state, the whole defensive strategy collapses. He never changed his style and never changed his scheme. With one move by Duncan, the whole team automatically changed and everyone knew what position to take.       & The back-line was the same that De Zerbi had been using: Pol Lirola as right back, Merih Demiral and Gian Marco Ferrari as centre backs, and Rogério as left back. That’s why it is important to have a physically strong team because playing with such high intensity during an entire season is not easy. Who are the Five Most Tactically Astute Managers in Europe Right Now? In the defensive phase, the wingers press from the outside, using the cover shadows to block off any passing lanes to the flanks, and instead forcing the opposition into trying to play through the middle of the pitch where the Atalanta midfield can condense and create a high-pressure area with little room for the opposition to manoeuvre. Having the midfield support allowed them to go out wide and cover the flanks where, as per usual, Atalanta committed more players in attack. Gasperini knew how good Sassuolo’s ground game was, so Atalanta’s idea was that each player should be very close to each Sassuolo player, that is to say, to each possible receiver of the ball. In the video below you can see how the whole man-mark Juventus and the speed and intensity the Atalanta-players shifts across the pitch. Crosses from the sides are very rare from Atalanta and they have statistical backing of not using that approach. Passes go both around and through Torino as Atalanta look to create openings. Be the first to contribute! Gian Piero Gasperini made a couple of interesting changes in the starting XI. On the goal was Pierluigi Golini with a three-man defence of Berat Djimsiti, José Luis Palomino and Rafael Tolói supporting him. Company Credits Of those eight crosses, four were by Iličić. Atalanta has surprised everyone this season by finishing fourth and securing Europa League-qualification for next year. Rogério left back, went forward with Ferrari to play alongside Bourabia. However, while the movement between Kurtic and Conti on the right is straightforward with Conti always wide, Gomez and Spinazzola on the left combine and pick up different positions. Young players like Caldara, Conti, Freuler, Petagna, Leonardo Spinazzola and the peerless Franck Kessie have impressed throughout. Gian Piero Gasperini’s excellent tactical setup has created a multifaceted young team that can play in different styles and have plenty of ways to create chances and score goals. Bryan Cristante was brought in for €5 million following a successful loan spell the previous year however Atalanta, thanks to the ingenious Giovanni Sartori, yet again conducted smart business, loaning the midfielder to Roma for an initial €5 million and later selling him permanently making a €21 million profit off of him. This last match was not going to be an exception in their plan. Here we see a superb counterattack finished by the centre-back Caldara to clinch the win at Napoli. Any combination is possible. His role was to serve as a passing option but also drag players out of position centrally or stretch them out wide. Gasperini’s target this season was to guide Atalanta to Champions League football for next season and he’s delivered that in brilliant fashion. From their tiny stadium and with a cast of unlikely characters assembled on a minuscule wage budget, Atalanta have somehow risen to become Europe’s hardest-hitting underdog. With that first objective accomplished, the next thing was to recover the ball. Immediate and constant pressure is required for Gasperini’s system to work effectively and when it does work it’s extremely hard to play against, however, for a club like Atalanta with a limited amount of resources and lack of quality depth, it is too difficult to maintain throughout the season. Betting on Atalanta will be a torturous affair as predicting how their defence will play is a tough job but for the best odds on Atalanta, check out Betway88 Thai. The goalkeeper Gollini was thus forced to kick long balls throughout the match. Ilicic and Gomez usually stay in each half space and play short passes when receiving the ball always looking to go forward and attack.
