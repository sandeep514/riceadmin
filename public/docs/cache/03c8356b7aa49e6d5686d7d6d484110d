That was something that was, I think, very foreign to a lot of us because we'd never experienced it before—that wasn't part of the culture for women's soccer players because it didn't exist at a professional level. The newly formed club took to social media after their inclusion was confirmed, sharing an inspirational video revolving around how it is time to reshape expectations on and off the field and bring a revolution to women’s soccer in the United States. As, you know, female professional soccer players, we had to understand what it meant to get traded, you know, and not ‘you got put on this team, and you're going to stay there.’ Oh, right, we actually could get traded to another team.  <br>It was something that I've always been interested in and had done a few condo purchases in Boston and wound up renovating them. “Today we take an exciting step by announcing the first women majority-owned and led ownership group,” Portman said in a release by the NWSL.
