For the 2015–16 campaign, he averaged 20.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks across 34 games en route to earning unanimous WAC Player of the Year honors. James Harden (14.5), Russell Westbrook (7.4), Damian Lillard (4.7) and LeBron James (4.5), each of whom can lay claim to being one of the best isolation scorers in the NBA in the post-Michael Jordan era. </p> <p>[31] On 23 January 2020, Siakam was selected to his first career All-Star nod, being named a starter in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game. [28] On 8 November, Siakam scored a career-high 44 points in a 122–104 win over the Pelicans. </p> <p>[1] His three older brothers, Boris, Christian, and James, all played NCAA Division I basketball in the United States—Boris at Western Kentucky, Christian at IUPUI, and James at Vanderbilt. While it's not astronomical compared to some players in the league - Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo turns it over at an even higher rate (12.2 percent), for example - it is when compared to the likes of Harden (6.9 percent), Westbrook (8.4 percent), Lillard (8.8 percent) and James (7.8 percent). While he's shooting only 33.3 percent from 3-point range in the clutch, he's made 51.0 percent of his field goal attempts and 81.5 percent of his free throw attempts. I feel like it's been said at least 100 times by now, but there's nobody who could have seen this coming from Siakam this time last year. </p> <p>[17] On 13 January, Siakam recorded 24 points and a career-high 19 rebounds in a 140–138 double-overtime win versus the Washington Wizards. Of the 147 players who have played at least 20 clutch-qualifying games this season, only 15 have a higher usage rating than Siakam. Anything he can add to that makes him a very valuable player. By using NBA sites, you are agreeing to our revised :privacyPolicy and :termsOfUse, including our :cookiePolicy"}; Siakam was born in Douala, Cameroon, to Tchamo and Victorie Siakam, the youngest of four brothers. </p> <p>When the season was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic back in March, the Raptors sat behind only the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference standings with a 46-18 record. [4], On 23 June 2016, Siakam was selected by the Toronto Raptors with the 27th overall pick in the NBA draft,[5] with the franchise signing him to a rookie scale contract on 9 July. Although it's not the sexiest shot in today's NBA, Siakam would benefit from becoming a more efficient midrange shooter next. A lot of the times it's a simple straight-line drive when his defender haphazardly closes out on him... ...but Anunoby has flashed some bounce off the dribble this season, usually in the form of spin moves that would make Siakam proud. By using NBA sites, you are agreeing to our revised <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/privacy_policy.html\">Privacy Policy<\/a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/termsofuse\">Terms of Use<\/a>, including our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/privacy_policy.html#Cookies\">Cookie Policy<\/a>"; As the Raptors gear up for a return to action later this month, here are three key stats to know about the defending champs that could determine just how far they go down in Disney World. Siakam initially had little interest in basketball in stark contrast to his older brothers, all of whom earned scholarships with the sport to various NCAA Division I colleges. ); Do the Raptors have an answer for the league's best players? Of the 79 players who have attempted at least 100 shots from midrange this season, that's the third-worst rate in the league ahead of only Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon (25.4 percent) and Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler (31.0 percent). [19], In Game 3 of the Raptors' first-round playoff series against the Orlando Magic, Siakam tallied 30 points and 11 rebounds in the 98–93 victory. </p> <p>For Siakam specifically, he was more or less a bystander when the going got tough, relegated to setting on-ball screens for Leonard or spotting-up in the corners to maximize spacing for the two-time Finals MVP. </p> <p>[5] He recorded a then career-high 20 points during a 117–112 loss to the Golden State Warriors on 25 October 2017. In the future, that's either a kickout to Marc Gasol at the top of the perimeter when Taj Gibson commits to helping out or a drive in the opposite direction, where it isn't nearly as crowded. [8] On 1 January 2017, during a 123–114 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, he pulled down a season-high 10 rebounds. On the other, it's hard to believe he has another leap in him based on how much he has already improved in his career. And will OG Anunoby be able to contribute enough offensively?          </p> <p>He also matched his career-highs in both offensive rebounds and made free throws, and set a new career-high in field goals attempted. His father thus enrolled him in St. Andrew's Seminary in Bafia at age eleven. Spoiler: It's the third-best rate in the league. </p> <p>The five Raptors who are on the court always move on a string, with each player rotating in unison. As Raptors president Masai Ujiri, who had been at this camp, recalled, "His effort was memorable. Siakam has basically gone from playing essentially no one-on-one to being one of the NBA's most frequent isolation players. [21] In Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Siakam helped Toronto defeat Milwaukee in double-overtime, 118–112, putting up 25 points and bringing down 11 rebounds; the win cut the Bucks' series lead to 2–1. Siakam pulled down six rebounds and did not have an assist, accumulating a plus … You'd be hard pressed to find another player in the league whose game has changed that much in such a short period of time. window.gdprTextData.text = "NBA sites use cookies and similar technologies. It depends on how you look at it, but based on how new this all is to him, it's hard to be overly critical. [13], Heading into the 2018-19 campaign, Siakam emerged as a two-way force, and he would average 16.9 points a night to go along with 6.9 rebounds and 3.1 assists; he would also make a marked improvement in shooting from distance, increasing his three-point percentage by 14 points to 36 percent. After averaging 23 points and 9 rebounds in that series, he was named the D-League Finals MVP. While at this prep school, Siakam was neither widely known nor initially eligible. One, the Raptors have some incredible isolation defenders. Stat Just Happened: What is Pascal Siakam's ceiling as an isolation scorer? The 75 points he's scored in the clutch rank him 25th in the league and he's gotten those points rather efficiently. Will Siakam ever get to that point? He might not be developing as quickly as Siakam, but Anunoby has shown some encouraging signs of improvement this season. All rights reserved. Today, Toronto Raptors forward Pascal Siakam takes the spotlight. According to a story by Jackie MacMullan of ESPN, Pascal was effectively "hand-picked to embody his family's Catholicism." Anunoby has even been making teams pay for collapsing on his drives with greater frequency. Siakam played college basketball for the New Mexico State Aggies and was named the Western Athletic Conference Player of the Year in  2016. </p> <p>It's also a massive increase from last season when Siakam sported a measly usage rating of 13.7 percent in the clutch. </p> <p>College: New Mexico State "Stat Just Happened" is our new series where we'll pair an important stat with how it actually unfolded on the floor. The academic star of the family, Siakam originally wanted to become a Catholic priest; but by age fifteen, he had a change of heart. This season, he's almost tripled that total to be among the league leaders. [27], Siakam recorded 34 points, 18 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 block in 38 minutes played of the NBA's season-opening game to help the Raptors beat the New Orleans Pelicans 130–122. [1]  On 3 December, Siakam scored a season-high 14 points, which came in a 128–84 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. Hollis-Jefferson, Anunoby and Siakam do a great job of keeping players in front of them, but the likes of Lowry, Gasol, Ibaka, Fred VanVleet and Terence Davis know when to pounce on players to make them uncomfortable. For the Toronto Raptors, they'll be looking to build on what has already been an impressive title defence. [7] It marked not only his NBA debut, but the first NBA game that he had ever seen in person. This brings us to the second thing that 0.84 number speaks to: Nick Nurse's system. When watching some of the turnovers Siakam has committed in isolation this season, these are the ones that jump out because of how avoidable they are: It's normal for scorers like Siakam to get tunnel vision from time to time, but he does have a tendency to drive into the teeth of the defence without a clear plan. The views expressed here do not represent those of the NBA or its clubs. [18] On 13 February, he racked up a new career-high 44 points and hit a career-best 4 three-pointers in a 129–120 win over the Wizards; he thus became the 11th Raptor in franchise history to reach the 40-point plateau. </p> <p>window.gdprTextData.text = "NBA sites use cookies and similar technologies.

Seattle Mariners Mariners GM Jerry Dipoto's take on Seattle's trade acquisitions ; Seattle Mariners Mariners' Marco Gonzales dominates Angels with 4-hitter in 2-1 win According to NBA.com, Siakam has made only 32.1 percent of his midrange shot attempts this season. And when they are able to force a turnover, it's off to the races. [23] In Game 1 of the 2019 Finals, Siakam scored a playoff career-high 32 points in a 118–109 victory over the Golden State Warriors. </p> <p>(Over half of Siakam's turnovers this season have been bad passes or offensive fouls, many of which have come on those sorts of plays). </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:19:"pascal siakam stats";s:5:"links";s:7948:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/does-timothy-green-die-86e6ec'>Does Timothy Green Die</a>,
