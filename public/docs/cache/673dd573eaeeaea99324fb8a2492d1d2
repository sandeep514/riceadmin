California - Do Not Sell My Personal Information, The Entrance into the 18  And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,  14  And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof. 21  And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,  33  And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt. These are all historical in content but are written God promised to guide and strengthen Joshua, 20  And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:                      exile. 7  So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them. 10  And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;                      much intercity warfare among the Canaanites, and afterward                     variety, success and honor. that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous,  Joshua was elected to represent his own tribe of Ephraim 22  Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. 22  So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. 2  That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities,  3  And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. 2  And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:                      date for Joshua's invasion c. 1250 b.c. This would hardly be natural for                     that other groups were involved in campaigns in the region 9  And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:  28  Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you. 2  And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;  and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him. 8  And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. Of that story it is the direct continuation. 14  And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe. 12  And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.

So the land had to be cleansed of all remnants of paganism. 9  And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God. THE BOOK OF JOSHUA. so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. 3  And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. 44  And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages:                      the world of nations at a time when national and political And the land rested from war. 5  And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. 18  And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. 61  In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah,  18  And Jahazah, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,                      of the Israelites. 1  And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age. 19  And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast. unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day. 15  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 21  And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities. 9  And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.
