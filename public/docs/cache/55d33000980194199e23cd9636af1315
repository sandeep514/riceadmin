Nope, this isn’t the type of Valentine’s Day you’re probably thinking of, but the total opposite. The massacre, orchestrated by Al Capone, shocked the nation by its brutality.

Ultimately, Capone was arrested for tax evasion in 1931 and sent to Alcatraz. It is suspected that Moran was the intended target of the massacre but he arrived later than the others and saw the fake police officers entering the warehouse and fled the scene thinking it was a raid.

Between 1924 and 1930, the city of Chicago became one of the largest centers for gang activity in the country. Lining up the seven men inside in front of a wall like it was a raid, the men, joined by two others dressed as civilians, pulled machine guns and other weapons from their jackets and opened fire. McGurn hired lookouts and set them up in an apartment near the garage. Though the police never had enough evidence to convict Al Capone, the public knew he was responsible. As they exited, neighbors who had heard the rat-tat-tat of the submachine gun, looked out their windows and saw two (or three, depending on reports) policemen walking behind two men dressed in civilian clothes with their hands up.
