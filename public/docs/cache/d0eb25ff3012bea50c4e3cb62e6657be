He imagines himself smashing the head of Jimmy Snyder, a bully who terrorises him at school, but soon bursts out into a tirade of violence, directed against all the things and people that weigh heavy upon his shoulders: The only thing that makes any sense right then is my smashing JIMMY SNYDER's face. We use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve your experience. London: Hamish Hamilton, 2005. In the very moment when he realises that clinging to this last word is “not a complaint [but] […] a prayer” (17), he loses ‘I’. Directed by Stephen Daldry. - Publication as eBook and book At the end of this chapter Thomas admits to himself that the marriage between him and Grandmother Schell could have been a turning point in his life. Oskar is the nine-year-old protagonist of the novel: he’s extremely precocious and incredibly imaginative, but he has a lot of fears, worries, anxieties, and guilt. In all chapters of Grandfather Schell’s different pictures doorknobs appear. 4.1 Range of Competences/ Main Objective In this paper I will examine how the characters Oskar, Grandfather Schell, and Grandmother Schell cope with trauma, caused by the Dresden bombing and respectively, the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. After eight months of searching for the lock, Oskar is no closer to the truth. As mentioned above Oskar thinks a lot about adult themes but, when it comes to his feelings he describes his grief by wearing “heavy boots”: [...] I got incredibly heavy boots about how relatively insignificant life is” (86). This statement emphasises that Oskar is lost in his emotions, but again he can express his feelings in a very adult wayThe boy feels that his father's death forces him to feel bad. At the very end, when Oskar realises that his mother did not tell her about the phone call she received from his father on the day of his deathtoo, Oskar can break free from his melancholic silence and makes himself familiar with the surrounding his trauma had gradually estranged him from (324). The first chapter, in which Thomas comes into view, contains the story of the Grandfather meeting his future wife, Anna’s sister, in New York. He claims “[he and his wife] could have lived differently” (216) but, in the same paragraph he says that this would have meant to make the “impossible possible” (216). 7.3 Worksheets During this phasecontinuing life is impossible for the traumatised person because in their mind life actually takes place in the past. “I haven’t always been silent […], I couldn’t keep my mouth shut, the silence overtook me like a cancer” (16). Extremely precocious and strange, Oskar is a difficult character to interpret because he doesn’t act like a real nine-year-old and, therefore, seems less like a real character and more like a metaphor. This becomes clear before one of his therapy sessions with Dr. Fein: “I didn't understand why I needed help, because it seemed to me that you should wear heavy boots when your dad dies, and if you aren't wearing heavy boots, then you need help” (200). This is underlined by the fact that he accuses himself for having not at least died with them (132). The novel Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer, deals with a nine-year old boy, Oskar Schell, who tries to detect the meaning of a key, which he found in an envelope labelled “Black”, by his father, who has died in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In situations of grief a person can feel paralysed by the event happening to us. The included characterisation and background information will reveal the differences between the protagonist Oskar, and his grandparents. Oskar’s fervent invention and establishment of rules to protect himself from a dangerous world mirrors the United States’ rush to create elaborate and often ill-conceived rules and regulations that did more to soothe Americans psychologically than create any true security. Apparently, the image evokes the idea that the possibility to open the door is not given and therefore, the key which could have opened the door does not exist (anymore). 3.1 Oskar Schell [2] If not otherwise noted, quotes will be taken from this edition with the page numbers in brackets. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is Jonathan Safran Foer's novel about a young boy who embarks on a quest to find closure following his dad's death in the September 11 terrorist attacks. According to these events, he emphasises the continuation of life of the victim’s relatives. This is illustrated when Oskar says that “[b]eing with him [makes] my brain quiet” (12) and gives the reader a feeling that Oskar places great trust in his dad.His father’s death evokes a deep change in Oskar’s life course.To be able to cope with this loss, he tries to get distracted by thinking about creative inventions he could develop: “I could invent a teakettle that reads in Dad’s voice, so I could fall asleep […]” (1). Moreover, Caruth argues that the event is not completely involved in the consciousness and therefore, cannot be experienced entirely(Caruth, (2000), 85). Despite his being a possible stand-in for all Americans, Oskar is still an individual, evidenced by his pacifism, the way he misses his dad, and veganism—traits irrelevant to any sort of metaphorical reading. However, intense attractions that cannot be prevented by this layer do exist. As he walks around New York, Oskar carries a tambourine, which he shakes to try and calm himself. The exterior layer its system avoids a permanent overstimulation of the outside world. The reason for choosing thesubtopics namely ‘inventing’ and ‘heavy boots’ referring to Oskar; Grandfather Schell’s ‘aphasia’ and ‘the doorknobs’ and finally, ‘supressing’ and ‘the feeling of being needed’ with regard to Grandmother Schell reveal concreteness for the main topic. Use up and down arrows to review and enter to select. As Caruth claims, he tries to bring the past – the voice of his dad – into the present. Oskar’s first step into the ‘working through’ phase to overcome his trauma, described by LaCapra, is when he confesses to the renter, who is actually his grandfather, that he could not answer the phone when his dad called from the World Trade Center: “He needed me, and I couldn’t pick up [the phone]” (301). Another interesting parallel is Oskar’s complete disinterest in history and past wars, as evidenced by his confusion at Mr. Black’s journalistic career. Therefore,it is imaginable that he forbids himself to live a normal life. Nevertheless, knowing their marriage is not a usual one, they can handle the situation. This often leads to the inability to express feelings or thoughts, which are accompanied by the incapacity to progress to the ‘working through’ process(Ibid, 218).The narrative memory, as the psychologist and psychotherapistPierre Janet names the ‘working through’ process of LaCapra, enables traumatised people “to remember what happened to them at a certain point in the past, while at the same time realising that they are living now” (Ibid,218). Some scholars have suggested that Oskar offers an impressionistic look at the loss of innocence and sense of safety that Americans and, in particular, New Yorkers felt after 9/11. To cope with this loss, Oskar makes up rules, such as avoiding heights, and inventions, like a birdseed shirt, to create scenarios that guarantee his safety in a dangerous world. He more and more loses himself and his human features to love, to pray and thus, to hope; which means in reverse he loses the reason to take on everyday life. This reveals that he never believed that this could ever have happened. He lost the ability to express his words orallydue to the traumatic experience of the Dresden bombing in 1945, in which he has lost his love, Anna, and their unborn baby.Thomas Schell does not value himself a lot, he describes himself as a “fool” who is “worthless […], pathetic […] and helpless” (33). It is obvious, that the boy has developed these fears after the ''worst day'' (12). - Completely free - with ISBN Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is extremely sad and incredibly stylish. Concerning that his wife always reminds him of Anna and thus of his past, leaving her could be seen as a step into the future to overcome his trauma.When Mr. Schell writes a letter to his son Thomas, Oskar’s father, he tells him what has happened to him in the past, the bombing and the horrible loss of people he loved. The person affected suffers from delayed consciousness raising of the events as “the outside has gone inside without any mediation.” (Caruth, (1996), 59; Leys, 2). He also turns to science, the way his dad organized the universe, as when he plays the interview with Tomoyasu in his class and describes how atomic bombs work instead of focusing on human loss. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. Although Oskar still mourns his dad’s death at the novel’s end, instead of repeatedly imagining the moment of his dad’s death, he focuses on their last moments together.
