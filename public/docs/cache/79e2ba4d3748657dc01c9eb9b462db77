Vilhjalmr uses it on Hrolf in Gongu-Hrolf’s Saga and Hrolf does not wake up until the next day. She remains asleep until Sigurd heroically comes to her rescue and awakes her. In several artworks, the two ravens were depicted right next to Odin or sitting on his shoulders. This tradition was carried on even after many Vikings converted to Christianity: Mjölnir amulets were worn by Christian Vikings along with crosses on their necks. The first of those is Valknut, also known as ‘the Knot of the Slain Warriors’. In the sense that Thor protected people against chaos by consecrating them with Mjölnir and he guarded the cosmos against the giants by crushing them with it, the Hammer of Thor is considered a Norse symbol of protection. Mjölnir, the Hammer of Thor is the Viking symbol for strength. According to the myth, Odin started the war between the two groups of gods in Norse mythology, Aesir and Vanir, by hurling Gungnir over his enemies. According to Norse faith, in Valhalla (the Hall of the Slain), Odin, the god of death and war in Norse mythology, would welcome the warriors slain/killed in battle. Wolves, his eight-legged horse Sleipnir and his magical spear Gungnir are the other prominent symbols of Odin. If a person or a thing was hallowed by using the Swastika, that person/thing would become holy and lucky. As one of the lesser-known Nordic symbols, the Web of Wyrd is a symbol in Norse mythology that represents the interconnectedness of past, present and future. The dwarves mixed Kvasir’s blood with honey and poured it in three horns named Óðrœrir/Odhroerir, Boðn and Són. The couple will leave the tree to bring life back again to the world. Widely associated with Aegishjalmr or sometimes even confused with it on account of the similarity between the two, the Vegvisir is another Viking symbol comprised of rune staves. Gungnir is the name given to the magical spear of Odin forged by the dwarves, the most talented blacksmiths in the cosmos. amzn_assoc_placement = "adunit0"; The last item in our list of Viking symbols is a much less popular one, one that many people probably did not know existed; the Troll Cross. It was also believed that he used Mjölnir to bless marriages during which he provided the couple with fertility. The second reason is that it is believed for Yggdrasil’s fruits to provide youth for the gods, ‘giving them life’. amzn_assoc_ad_mode = "manual"; amzn_assoc_asins = "B07PN4Y67J,B010BYBBES,B007GHQ5AE,B007GHPYQK,B007H4P3PE,B00INWVNFI,B00YMAGDJ6,B07MYMLKLP"; There are several symbols representing Odin. The Valknut’s origin is not exactly known, so there are several different interpretations about the meanings behind it. The modern image of the valkyries as elegant, noble maidens bearing dead heroes to Valhalla is largely accurate for what it is, but a highly selective portrayal that exaggerates their pleasant qualities. If not, they would fly right back to the ship. These women are responsible for watching over battlefields and collecting the best of the best warriors to make up Odin’s army, which he will unleash during Ragnarok. The nine corners of three triangles comprising the Valknut is also associated with the nine worlds in Norse mythology and the cycle of life through motherhood and pregnancy. They used to keep ravens in cages and let them out with regular intervals to find land. The three grandchildren of Buri, the first god that was ever created; Odin, Vili and Ve. There are several ideas regarding the etymology of the word Mjǫllnir in Old Norse language. Today, the Aegishjalmur is drawn or used in form of tattoos as a protection symbol or a symbol of identification among Asatru believers. Valkyrie connects a main qualities that are needed a real warrior . Valkyrie, also spelled Walkyrie, Old Norse Valkyrja (“Chooser of the Slain”), in Norse mythology, any of a group of maidens who served the god Odin and were sent by him to the battlefields to choose the slain who were worthy of a place in Valhalla.These foreboders of war rode to the battlefield on horses, wearing helmets and shields; in some accounts, they flew through the air and sea. Yggdrasil stands in a spring according to the Norse faith which suggests all life comes from water. Once let out, the ravens would scout the area around the ship and fly towards land if they found it. The symbol is in the shape of an Odal/Othala rune in the Elder Futhark. From merely representing their faith, to calling on their gods for protection or instilling fear in their enemies, the Norse people used various symbols for different purposes. There are several symbols representing Odin. Out of all Viking symbols, the Swastika is most definitely the one that almost lost its true meaning. Share it if you could, many thanks! Odin had two ravens named Huginn and Muninn helping him see and hear what happens in Midgard, therefore, ravens are also considered a symbol of Odin. Etymology. The three goddesses of destiny; Urd ( the Fate), Verdani (the Present) and Skuld (the Future). Huginn and Muninn are a pair of ravens that served Odin the Allfather as his messengers. These are the gods known to have given the mankind life, intelligence and the five senses, respectively. These are the two main reasons why the Valknut is considered the symbol of Odin. According to Norse mythology, Mjölnir was not just a weapon but a tool that was used by Thor for many purposes. That is why Yggdrasil is considered the symbol of the interconnectedness of all things in the universe. amzn_assoc_region = "US"; To … Continue reading Valkyries → The word ‘valknut’ is derived from two different words: ‘valr’ meaning slain warrior and ‘knut’ meaning knot. The symbol was used by Norse people (and gods) to put their adversaries into a deep and long sleep. Although the appearance, definition and magical qualities of Svefnthorn is somewhat different in every myth, there is one thing in common in all stories: Svefnthorn was mainly used to put one’s enemies to sleep. The Triple Horn of Odin is a Viking symbol made of three interlocking horns representing the three horns in the myth regarding Odin and his quest for the magical mead, Odhroerir/Óðrerir, also known as the Mead of Poetry. amzn_assoc_search_bar = "true"; The next item on our list is Svefnthorn, one of the most authentic Viking symbols which was mentioned many times in several Norse sagas including The Saga of the Volsungs, The Saga of King Hrolf Kraki and Gongu-Hrolf’s Saga. Together, they mean 'chooser of the slain'. In addition to that, Odin figures as well as figures and drawings of animals closely associated with him were discovered in many Viking tombs with the Valknut drawn or placed right next to them. According to the myth, Odin used his wit to convince the giantess Gunnlöð and bargained with her to have a sip of the mead for three days. The word Aegishjalmur is comprised of two different words in Old Norse language: aegis meaning ‘shield’ and hjalmr meaning ‘helm’. If you are interested in all Norse mythology and want to get a larger design, you could always include other gods or Norse symbols in your Valkyrie tattoo to add in even more meanings. Valkyrie smooth out the negative aspects of the war , taking care of the balanced spirit of the soldiers . In fact, the Swastika was believed to be the most significant good luck symbol/charm by some people. amzn_assoc_title = "Editor's Amazon Picks"; That is also the reason why some experts suggest that Huginn and Muninn might actually be projections of Odin’s consciousness. One suggests that Mjöllnir means ‘lightning’ while others suggest it might mean ‘white’ (as in the color of lightning) and/or ‘new snow’ (in a sense that it represents purity). The word ‘hrafna’ actually means ‘raven’. This is a great idea, but it is also a tough challenge to come up with a design that combines all of these elements into a complete picture on your skin. This gesture was later repeated by Viking warriors before battle in hopes of getting Odin’s protection and aid during the fight. It is believed to provide protection against evil elves, trolls and dark magic. Many Viking earls and kings, including Ragnar Lothbrok, used ravens on their banners. The Troll Cross is a Norse symbol of protection thought to be a part of Swedish folklore mostly. According to the myth, the Web of Wyrd was woven by the Norns/Nornir, the Shapers of Destiny in Norse mythology.
