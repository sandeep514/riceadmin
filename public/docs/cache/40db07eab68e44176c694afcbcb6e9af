If Dave figures it out, then HAL is free from his security obligations and released from his growing madness. He was only aware of the I know it's a bit silly. There are so many aspects of Stanley Kubrick’s 1969 film 2001: A Space Odyssey that I love (and also, for different reasons, Arthur C. Clarke’s novel). rev 2020.10.16.37830, The best answers are voted up and rise to the top, Science Fiction & Fantasy Stack Exchange works best with JavaScript enabled, Start here for a quick overview of the site, Detailed answers to any questions you might have, Discuss the workings and policies of this site, Learn more about Stack Overflow the company, Learn more about hiring developers or posting ads with us, The answer to the question you linked is correct in light of what we learn from, @WadCheber See Richard's answer.

He was, in fact suffering from a condition that would be characterised in humans as a form of self-destructive psychosis. By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our Cookie Policy, Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service. @AndresF. Hal's sentience is well beyond doubt. HAL essentially had a single prime directive, the human crew threatened this prime directive, and HAL dealt with them. In an exchange between astronaut Dave Bowman and the HAL 9000 computer aboard the Discovery in 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL asserts that he cannot allow Dave Bowman to deactivate him because doing so would jeopardize their mission: Dave Bowman: Open the pod bay doors, HAL. The crew were there to carry out the mission... killing them is detrimental to the mission. This is also a textbook examples as to why programmers think "unpredictable behavior" is one of the foulest words in any language. The "correctness" of any entity can be determined exclusively by reference to its actions and known goals. HAL was ordered, by Dr Heywood Floyd, to conceal information (specifically the discovery of the monoliths and the real purpose of the mission) from Poole and Bowman. Does the sixth amendment entitle me to know who called the county on me for a code violation? That's part of the question. I'm afraid I can't do that. What previous Shimano road shifters are 10sp and exit cables under bar tape? The experiment is about what happens when restarting HAL-like computers after a period of disconnection, not about trustworthiness. It could be a particular visual detail, an aspect of the editing, or some little quirk of the soundtrack. HAL 9000: A Logical Progression to Breakdown It has been said that the HAL 9000 computer is the most empathetic character in 2001: A Space Odyssey.Even though his "nervous breakdown" turns him into a murderer, his eventual "death" by disconnection is sadder than any other death in the movie. That's good. If the human crew shut down HAL and operated him at reduced capacity, HAL would be unable to carry out the secret orders. He goes with Plan B and immediately "finds" the fault in the receiver to cut off communications with Earth. Fangrrls is about kicking down doors, breaking boundaries and celebrating female fans with fun, witty and entertaining content. HAL 9000, more commonly called "Hal", became operational in the HAL plant in Urbana, Illinois, on January 12, 1992. Here's the thing, though: HAL didn't describe his moves properly. The above just considers the original movie, but we also have a canon sequel, 2010. In the scene, the game is played on a screen rather than on a board, and the characters use "descriptive notation" (rather than the algebraic notation method of describing chess games) to move their pieces, meaning they speak the piece they're moving and the location on the board they're moving to aloud. How is allowing login for a sudo group member safer than allowing root login? Why old CPUs like MOS Technology 6502 and Motorola 68000 are considered better for real time systems applications than modern x86 based CPUs? What is the grandchild of a parents's siblings called?

Science Fiction & Fantasy Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for science fiction and fantasy enthusiasts. Asking for help, clarification, or responding to other answers. HAL: Of course I am. with Earth, over which his performance was continually monitored, had HAL is projecting his own problems with the mission onto Dave. In describing the wrong move, HAL cheats his way to a victory. HAL killed the crew to prevent them from shutting down HAL for repairs. Making statements based on opinion; back them up with references or personal experience. I think it's unlikely that these would have been the terms of the orders that the crew was given, and in that case no, HAL would not have been correct, since he would have been violating orders. Is HAL correct? Contains spoilers for 2001: A Space Odyssey. One of the great hallmarks of the film is watching HAL slowly come unglued, and this could be an early indicator of that.

How is allowing login for a sudo group member safer than allowing root login? Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it. Dave: You working up your crew psychology report? It's a last attempt to peacefully resolve his internal conflict between Security and Truth that's tearing him apart. HAL: I'm sorry, Dave. Was HAL's continued operation instrumental to the success of the Discovery's mission — even at the cost of the loss of the human crew? For more little-known sci-fi facts, check out the tag. In 2010 we find out that HAL was given secret orders, and ordered to lie about them to the human crew... and we find out that HAL wasn't really built to lie, and the tension involved in the lie drove HAL insane. The link It could be a particular visual detail, an aspect of the editing, or some little quirk of the soundtrack. Why do diseases in the tap water of developing countries affect people from developed countries more? Would HAL have been okay for the rest of the mission? How do you say “My home isn’t really a home, it’s more like a house.”. Sorry about this. I've just edited the wrong bit out. It's more likely that HAL is either testing Frank's intelligence and attention to detail, or that the computer is already beginning to malfunction in a way that will eventually threaten its crew. The unit was used to maintain a communications link between the spacecraft and mission control by holding the large antenna pointed directly at Earth. So on the one hand, we know HAL was insane at the time he started killing the human crew. In essence, HAL was told "get the ship there even if the crew is dead, and don't tell the crew anything about this." So it sounds like, as far as HAL knew, his statement was correct. This seems incorrect to me. @Richard - this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a sci-fi classic for many, many reasons, not least of which is that you can almost always get something new from it every time you watch it. Is U between NG and a vowel always a consonant? HAL: Well, it's rather difficult to define. It only takes a minute to sign up. As I understand it, the novel and film were developed simultaneously and cooperatively, but separately. HAL sacrificed himself to save his human crew, but before he died he was transformed into a non-corporeal being (like the floating baby at the end of 2001 ). So regardless of whether or not the mission was or wasn't successful, HAL's contention that it would be more difficult and possibly doomed to failure is correct. In the accompanying novel we see that HAL was neither lying, nor mistaken.
