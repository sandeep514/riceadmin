"[25], The train continued east from Halsted Station to the 1934 Century of Progress fair on the Lake Michigan shore, where it arrived for the "Wings of a Century" pageant on opening day. The train left Denver at 07:04 Central Daylight Time and at 20:09, 13 hours 5 minutes later, broke through the tape at the designated finish line at Halsted Street station, 1.8 miles west of Chicago Union Station. The non-stop 1,015 mile (1,633 km) trip exceeded the railroad's expectations in being 1 hour 55 minutes faster than was scheduled. The train set was so lightly disguised as the fictional "AMRoad" that the locomotives and cars still carried their original names and numbers, along with the easily identifiable CPR Action Red paint scheme, as well as the CP "Multimark" logo. American Society of Mechanical Engineers (November 18, 1980). The problems were most acute under the operating conditions of locomotive, rather than stationary or marine, use. An operable Nebraska Zephyr train was donated to IRM. The cost of the set, its filming and equipment totalled five hundred thousand dollars, which averaged to about thirty-six thousand dollars for each second of the sequence. River Raisin Models released a ready-to-run model in. The scene shows an old woman flying. At that time, the steam locomotive that shared the display space with the Zephyr, Santa Fe #2903, was donated to the Illinois Railway Museum (IRM) at Union, west of Chicago, while MSI prepared a new display location for the Zephyr. When the scene where Grover (Richard Pryor) puts the shoe polish on George's (Gene Wilder's) face to make him appear to be black was first filmed, a white man walked in and believed George was black. The plane was painted with a water-soluble "silver" paint to cover its original colors-white overall, with an orange strip down the sides and orange leading edges. The train was rebuilt and re-entered revenue service soon afterward, but the accident drove home the advantages for crew safety of the elevated, behind-the-nose cab design of the contemporary EMC E-series locomotives. Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pennsylvania has a miniature replica train ride called Zephyr which was built in 1935 and helped the park survive the Great Depression.[39]. [35] As of November 2019, MSI has temporarily closed the exhibit to add new interactive elements and an expanded experience.[36].     |                         [8], Naming the train was a task that was very seriously taken by Budd. Riding the train were Ralph Budd, Edward G. Budd, Harold L. Hamilton, president of the Electro-Motive Corporation, a number of reporters, some Burlington employees, members of the public, and Zeph, a burro that was contributed by a Colorado newspaper, the Rocky Mountain News, as a mascot for the train.

[15]  The result was a diesel-electric drive system developed by GM's subsidiary Electro-Motive Corporation, powered by an eight-cylinder, 600 hp Winton 201A diesel engine, installed in a new three car stainless steel streamliner within a year. The last of the classic Zephyrs, 9908, entered service as the General Pershing Zephyr between Kansas City and St. Louis in 1939, replacing the less commodious 9902 set. Behind the engine in the first car was a 30 ft (9.1 m) long railway post office section. After the nine original Zephyr sets were completed during 1934-1938, standard production model diesel passenger locomotives with improved engines became available. Included among the American Film Institute's 2000 list of the Top 100 Funniest American Movies. The protagonist's first name is George, and the heroine's last name is Burns. The third and final car in the train, as originally built, was configured as half coach (40-passenger seats) and half observation car (12 passenger seats). The articulation not only reduced the number of trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. The Silver Streak, just west of downtown Calgary. The story begins with pilgrims setting out on a journey, inspired by the budding springtime and by Zephyrus, the gentle and nurturing west wind. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyr's crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. Alternate Versions Chicago Railroad Fair Official Guide Book (1949). That sequence was filmed from a Hi-Rail truck entering the Chicago and North Western Railway's downtown Chicago terminal. GM's next generation diesel engine had pistons with a useful life of over 500,000 miles. In developing the Budd-Michelin railcars, the Budd Company used the formed steel technology in which they were industry pioneers and solved the most difficult problem in using stainless steel for railcar construction: developing a welding technique that would not compromise the strength and corrosion resistance of the stainless steel. This is the same spot as above, only the angle is wrong due to the fence. Each "manor" car was configured with 3 sets of upper/lower berths, 4 single bedrooms, 6 double bedrooms, 2 common washrooms and a common shower. The fair's purpose was to celebrate 100 years of railroad history west of Chicago, and the Pioneer Zephyr's role in the pageant was to highlight the latest strides in railroad technology. [16][26] In that story, the crew was racing to the Boulder Dam construction site with an iron lung, with only moments to spare. 9908 used the new 1000 hp GM 567 engine in a single engine configuration. The 9902 set inaugurated the Ozark State Zephyr, a joint operation with the Alton Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City, where it was joined by the 9904 on alternate timing about a year later. One of the railroad presidents who faced this challenge was Ralph Budd, formerly of the Great Northern Railway and now president of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (Burlington), who sought to develop a more efficient high speed train to replace conventional steam-powered heavyweight equipment. The existing gasoline powerplants for motorized railcars were inadequate and gasoline engines showed limited potential for higher capacity hauling applications. The exterior design of the train was left to aeronautical engineer Albert Gardner Dean (Walter Dean's younger brother) who designed the sloping nose shape, with architects Paul Philippe Cret and John Harbeson, devising a way to strengthen and beautify the sides with the train's horizontal fluting. On May 31, 1936, the trainsets of the Pioneer Zephyr and the Mark Twain Zephyr, 9900 and 9903, were transferred to a new Chicago-Denver service called the Advance Denver Zephyr on a 16 hour schedule. The second car consisted of a small baggage section and a short buffet and 20-passenger coach section. [12] On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. Just over five years after it was introduced, the Pioneer Zephyr crossed the one million mile mark in regular service on December 29, 1939, near Council Bluffs, Iowa. [3][30], In 1939 the Pioneer Zephyr was involved in a head-on collision with a freight train that completely destroyed the cab. [3] When Amtrak took over passenger rail services in 1971, the legendary Zephyr name was preserved, and the California Zephyr is an Amtrak route in the 21st century.     |                         The GSL (car dealer) sign is a city landmark. He wanted a name that started with the letter Z because this train was intended to be the "last word" in passenger service; Budd and his coworkers looked up the last words in their dictionaries, but neither zymurgy nor zyzzle conveyed the meanings that Budd was looking for. Pneumatic-wheeled railcars never found popularity for actual service in the US — they tended to derail — but they demonstrated the successful construction of lightweight stainless steel unibody railcars. At that time, the 9901 was reassigned to a new service, the Sam Houston Zephyr, running between Fort Worth and Houston via Dallas on trackage jointly owned by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific. The locomotive was a FP7A built by GMD in 1952. Due to the Zephyr's success on this test run, the Burlington immediately ordered two more Zephyr trainsets that were dubbed the "Twin Zephyrs", starting the spread of the Zephyr brand. The film score is by Henry Mancini. As with the earlier General Pershing Zephyr and Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr the new Silver Streak Zephyr no longer operated with articulated train sets or for that matter even articulated cars. Budd saw the compact, efficient system in action, saw a major piece of his lightweight train puzzle fall into place, then approached GM about adapting their engine for rail propulsion. Silver Streak is a 1976 American buddy comedy thriller film about a murder on a Los Angeles-to-Chicago train journey. When George and Grover are driving in the stolen car to Kansas City, there is a long shot at night where you see the headlights and hear soft music by Jerry Goldsmith. [4], Ralph Budd and the Burlington capitalized on the Zephyr's success. For power the new five car lightweight streamliner was assigned a new EMD E5A unit developing 2,000 horsepower (1,500 kW) Passengers were obviously pleased with the new Silver Streak Zephyr as ridership showed a marked increase within days of the new trains entry into service.
