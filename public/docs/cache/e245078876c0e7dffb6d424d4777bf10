</html>";s:4:"text";s:11660:"Do you have any plans for the 22nd? Let's face it. It was a long flight. Avatar makes its Blu-ray and DVD debut on Earth Day, April 22nd, 2010. So, yes, I still want to encourage people to see it. Immediately you lost the physicality. I hope I'm not saying that off the top of my head. Arriving just in time for Earth Day, Avatar will make both its Blu-ray and DVD debut, and its sure to be a best seller. Good stories are worth seeing. Because they are entertaining themselves in an imaginary way with imaginary creatures and avatars. Then, all of a sudden, that has happened, and you are suddenly inside an airplane with the tiniest screen on earth. What do you have to say to the select few that haven't seen the film yet? But that is still their imaginations putting all of that stuff to work. This is as much of a mystery to me as it is to you and all the people waiting for the sequel. Do you often sit behind people on airplanes and tap them on the shoulder when you catch them watching one of your movies? But I didn't want her to have that history. -CCH Pounder repetirá en Avatar 2 Mucha gente espera la llegada del Día de la Tierra en Estados Unidos el próximo 22 de abril, y el motivo no es otro que el estreno en Blu-ray y DVD de 'Avatar'. Even in terms of our imaginations, because we no longer go outside and pretend a stick and a rock is a ball and a bat. That doesn't mean those ideas are negative. Because we've established the language. CCH Pounder: No! I tapped him on the shoulder and said, "Is it not translating because the screen is too small?" But he did. Presentado el menú de PS5, ¿qué opinas de la nueva interfaz de usuario de PlayStation. Then we will go to Washington D.C. and have a conversation on the mall. Whatever he does!" © 2002-2020 Filmaffinity - Movieaffinity | Filmaffinity es una página de recomendación de películas y series, y es un medio totalmente independiente cuya principal prioridad es la privacidad y seguridad de los datos de sus usuarios. I don't know if you know anything about James Cameron, but he is incredibly detailed. I don't look blue. I thought, "Oh, God! The next one is going to be even more about story. What happened with that film? CCH Pounder: None. CCH Pounder: (Laughs) I am amazed. The film literally changed the way we watch movies. That will happen on Earth Day with a gazillion other people. CCH Pounder: Interesting. Maybe not for a "personality". The sci-fi phenomenon arrives on DVD and Blu-ray in time to celebrate Earth Day this April 22nd. On April 22nd, the motion picture experience that changed the way we watch movies is finally coming home. They have conventions where that's all they are allowed to speak. CCH Pounder: It was called Arbor Day! I never like to draw on anything I have done before. I don't know exactly what that entails, or how that will be set-up in this culture that James Cameron is still creating. Además de los protagonistas de la primera entrega (Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder… Reparto: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Peter Mensah, Laz Alonso, Wes Studi, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez. Its turned into its own phenomenon. For instance, Zoe Saldana was there for two and a half years. Maybe there is some kind of repetition in that. That was the premise. CCH Pounder: I was only involved with saying, "No!" A very fat white woman. Estaran de broma no? I don't know that any of James Cameron's films ever take just three months. I am attracted to characters that start off at one place, and they are so influenced by another character that their life has to change. And we are being swept up in that as actors. Now, it has become more highlighted when I think of the missing tree element through all my travels. That is a really indulgent place to be. And he said, "It is really intense. TÍTULO ORIGINAL: Avatar AÑO: 2009 DURACIÓN: 161 min. I don't swim. Because your life doesn't come up to it. This was called Arbor Day back when I was a kid. I don't think we are ever going to lose that capacity. Ben's too short to be in the Na'vi nation. Timing is everything, isn't it? I feel very blessed to have worked with James at this time. CCH Pounder: Is it a big deal? They were having suicidal thoughts, which I thought was insane. That had a lot to do with spirituality and authority. Did you pass Ben Stiller any hints on how to use his tail at this year's Oscars? And belligerent. That means advertisers and promoters become the great manipulators of human life. James Cameron's sci-fi spectacle Avatar is the all-time highest grossing film both domestically and internationally. Not for me! Everyone asks, "Oh, my God! There were all of these incredible contrasts. The bells and whistles are this new technology. Whoopi Goldberg was the most well known black woman at that time. (Laughs) He will come up with something that I'm sure will delay it. I think they owed time to Jean Stapleton. That is where we will plant the first tree. She went ahead and did it. That would have meant pulling off a human trait. Of this size. Because television had all of these other things wrapped around it, they thought, "We've got to give Jean Stapleton a show. Avatar 5 --James Cameron. Here you are after all this fuss and drama about not opening it up until they had enough screens. Did you actually sit down and think Moat's whole life through to this point, here? But it was great to have a regular conversation, just to get someone's real opinion. There had to be this idea that if Eytukan, played by Wes Studi died, the clan would simply be taken over by Moat. They went through a year and a half delay making sure there were enough screens around the country. He had been living with this story for such a long time. I actually sat behind a fellow watching it on the plane. CCH Pounder: It hasn't affected me at all. ¿Ha hablado James Cameron con usted sobre regresar a Pandora?, ¿Continuará la Reina Moat en este Universo?. So I asked him when it was over, "What did you think?" This is one of the greatest places an actor can be. Historia de un ex-Marine que se verá envuelto en una guerra entre fuerzas alienígenas … The technology of film is changing. All of these things are from the human imagination, and that is not going to change. I believe it is on the Fox lot. James Cameron's sci-fi spectacle Avatar is the all-time highest grossing film both domestically and internationally. So, yeah, it's gone. With all the technology in place, is it still going to take you another year and a half to shoot your character this next time out, or are you going to be able to go in, like on a normal film, and knock it out in three months time? CCH Pounder: I think it is easy. CCH Pounder: They are not a lost cause. CCH Pounder Is Queen Moat in James Cameron's ‘Avatar’ [Exclusive]. I've done the film. The problem back in the 80s, when you did something really well on film and they wanted it to become a TV show, was that there was a pretty standardized formula. Do you see a problem in the future with these two worlds colliding? The only thing that bothers me is that there were a lot of calls coming in. He walks like me. (Laughs). But I can immediately see the difference. She was already "on the page" powerful. CCH Pounder: (Laughs) Do you think? It puts the whole thing in perspective. Where you feel a movie can so influence your life that you are prepared to die. But maybe for the fans. I do think the way we play hasn't changed in a thousand, gazillion years. CCH Pounder: I was there for a year and a half (Laughs). Or are they a lost cause at this point in the game? They hear he is such a tyrant. ... John Stamos, Kim Delaney, CCH Pounder, Robert Carradine, Claire Yarlett, Dimitra Arliss... Por su propio bien (TV)--Ed Kaplan. Because we don't have that here on Earth. CCH Pounder: I don't get demoted. The super surround sound that you'd get in the theater. I don't think he recognized my voice. He watched it for a little bit and turned it off. Avatar is being released on Earth Day. CCH Pounder: I prayed that he didn't remember me from our meeting on The Abyss. Old human errors. The film is almost an alien world unto itself. I'll tell you what I am attracted to. We said that Esperanza was going to be the new business language of the world, and that still hasn't caught on fire. A foreigner. I had a really fantastic experience in terms of watching someone's creativity come alive and get put to the test. This was an environment that was created by the human imagination. Which was so far from the original story of dissatisfaction. People were very depressed that the environment we created in Avatar was so beautiful, and so imaginative, and colorful, and Zen like. I don't know if it will be that long. The first one took so much thought in putting it all together. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Oona Chaplin, CCH Pounder, Michelle Yeoh. Has James Cameron talked to you about returning to Pandora for Part 2? (Laughs) Or dress in any way like my character. I like to start with a clean slate. It's been fantastic. I think that happened with Star Trek. We've established the environment.  Old mistakes. Just being big and bad was not enough to survive The Abyss. Sinopsis. I was going to ask you how your life has changed since appearing in the biggest film of all time, but people aren't recognizing you even after having just watched the film, I can't imagine that it has affected you too much? How do you think Avatar will hold up in the home theater environment? She said, "I'm not going to do this if you want to do it." It would be pretty amazing if we created a language and that became the hottest thing. I like interesting, and clever, and great directing. Have you held onto your ability to speak Na'vi? They get married in Klingon weddings. His techno-mind is that amazing. What sort of cultural royalty did you draw from in creating this beautiful creature? I don't think he will be offended. No se kien la vera.. . It took you, personally, a year and a half to shoot your role in the film. I am going to take my nap and watch it when I wake up." Can a woman become head of the tribe? It was one that people stuck by even though it didn't work. What you see is what I brought to the table, pretty much. They just take it for granted. (Laughs) It hasn't bothered me at all. I'm interested to know more about that. Did you have anything to do with that? To help celebrate this upcoming release, which is set to break even more records, we caught up with actress CCH Pounder, who plays Moat, mother of Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and Queen of the Na'vi people in the film. We are going to do the kick off this Thursday. You were in The Bagdad Café, which was a movie I didn't see until last year, when Avatar came out. There was this internal dissatisfaction, as opposed to all of these external forces changing her lifestyle. She asked me, "Do you want to do this?" Now it's the next phase in the "Na'vi meet the humans" storyline. The fact that you are creating a whole new environment, and a humanoid creature? I am fascinated by that encounter. In a funny way, I feel left out. CCH Pounder is Queen Moat in James Cameron's Avatar. My timing has been remarkable. To absorb this type of movie. Carol Christine Hilaria Pounder (Georgetown, Guayana británica; 25 de diciembre de 1952) es una actriz estadounidense tanto de cine como de televisión. Is it a super big deal? Imagine the size of that screen. You could be making a little extra money on the side teaching the fanboys to speak this language.
