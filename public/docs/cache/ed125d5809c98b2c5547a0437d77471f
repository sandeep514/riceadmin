The acting was bad, and the music added an extra cheese factor. Myers is supposed to be age six when Halloween begins in 1963. An interesting movie, very cute and sweet! There have been a handful of sequels to the classic Rankin and Bass Christmas special Frosty the Snowman, two of them by Rankin and Bass themselves.

The image is an example of a ticket confirmation email that AMC sent you when you purchased your ticket. This direct-to-video sequel takes place five years after the first movie; Ralphie, having worn down his father enough to get a Red Ryder carbine action 200-shot range model air rifle, now has his heart set on a car. All of the murders we see happen in the original Halloween are tied to sexual activity: Myers stabs his sister to death after she’s been fooling around with a boy. —J.S. The streaming network announced the news by sharing a holiday greeting card from Santa and Mrs. Claus! <br> <br>We also have to assume Goldie Hahn will be back as Mrs. Claus.  <br>While she’s in a high school class and Myers is lurking outside, Laurie answers a teacher’s question about destiny. In the end credits, the music is listed as being performed by The Bowling Green Philharmonic Orchestra. The Christmas Card doesn't have much in the way of cynicism and snark. You can see Loomis looking at a matchbook in a car with his colleague Marion Chambers early in the movie. —E.S. The thing about that theme song: John Carpenter, who scored the movie himself as he did with many of his movies, clearly understood its power.

(Today’s masters of horror could learn a thing or two from its less-is-more potency). Home on leave, a soldier (John Newton) visits a small town and falls for the woman (Alice Evans) who wrote a well-wishing card to the troops. So it is here: Curtis’s Laurie, especially for her age in the late 1970s, stays covered up and doesn’t kiss a single person. But it’s worth revisiting the movie that started it all to see how many deeper nuances were hiding just below the surface of Carpenter’s sublime terror. <br> <br>There’s more than enough time for that to happen, too. Few things are scarier than actual history, as Stacy Schiff's painstakingly researched and beautifully written account of the Salem Witch Trials—which began in 1692 and ended less than a year later, with 25 people dead—shows. At around 200 pages, it's a quick read—and when you're done, you can fire up one of the novel's TV and film adaptations to keep the creepiness going. <br> <br>They won't be able to see your review if you only submit your rating. An American soldier fighting the War in Afghanistan falls in love with a woman who sent him an anonymous Christmas card in this patriotic Hallmark Channel movie … There’s been little written about Christmas Chronicles 2. While Laurie walks around town and Myers pursues her, she sings a couple lyrics that sound sweet but are haunting in context: “Wish I had you all alone / Just the two of us.” Internet digging reveals that it’s not a pop song, but rather it could be a reference to her repressed romantic feelings, or a nod to what will become her ongoing connection to Myers.

Director: Steven R. Monroe | Stars: Taylor Cole, Michael Rady, Brooklyn Rae Silzer, Jeff Branson. The first, Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House, yet again puts Kevin McCallister (Mike Weinberg) in the position of having to defend his house—actually his divorced dad’s girlfriend’s house, where he’s spending Christmas—from thieves. Those thieves are played by French Stewart and Missi Pyle, the first stepping in for Daniel Stern as the dim-witted Marv. (To be fair, he did get help on the songs from a few friends.).

It starts in the town of Castle Rock, Maine, which becomes terrorized by a once-friendly Saint Bernard. We’ll be sure to let you know when that happens! <br> <br>Curtis, of course, is the daughter of Janet Leigh, who had one of the most memorable roles in a scary movie ever with Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho.
