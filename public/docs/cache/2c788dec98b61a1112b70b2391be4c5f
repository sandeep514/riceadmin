It almost reaches the poetry of a John Ford film, or a great film noir, but falls just a little short. Fritz Lang, the director, was quite a guy -- the last of the red hot authoritarians. It’s the kind of pessimism that marks many of Lang’s films from the 50s. We didn’t make everything in the studio — the scenes in the street we shot on Republic’s Western Street. She’d arrive, fully done, on the set!”, “Now, Marlene resented going gracefully into a little, tiny bit older category,” Lang said. It’s part of Fritz Lang’s later Hollywood output — a string of cheaper, independent films often dismissed by admirers of his earlier work. I said, ‘Why are you doing it this way?’ He said, ‘I’ll tell you, Dan. ), In her autobiography, Marlene Dietrich wrote, “Fritz Lang was the director I detested most…. Dietrich never concealed her disliking for the film and Fritz Lang. Rancho Notorious was produced during Howard Hughes’ reign at RKO. They did not exist. In fact it's a pretty bad Western, really, but somehow it manages to be a lot of fun. His revenge leads him to Chuck-a-luck, Altar Keane's ranch set up to hide criminals, and he finds more than he bargains for. Gorgeous color. 				Change ), You are commenting using your Facebook account. But anyone who expects a western picture to match the character of its ab… The newcomer quickly catches Altar's eye. When the man realizes that Vern is just fishing for information, Vern is forced to kill him in self-defense.     |                         Posted in 1952, DVD reviews, releases, TV, etc., Fritz Lang, RKO | 											5 Comments. Dietrich needed a stronger leading man than Ferrerr and Kennedy. I want a script that even an idiot can shoot.’”, Rancho Notorious tells the tale of rancher Vern Haskall (Arthur Kennedy) whose fiancé (Gloria Henry) is raped and murdered in a holdup. Likewise with the story idea. Obviously, they were right. And I, for one, feel this picture is worthy of an official Special Edition-type release. Vern makes it his life work to track down the killer and punish him, but he has very few clues. Vern reveals his true purpose and his disdain for Altar's profession. 13 Songs. He winds up at a place known as Chuck-a-Luck, a ranch and front for a criminal hideout that is run by smouldering chanteuse Altar Keane {Marlene Dietrich}. I was showing him pages — that was mandatory. Mel Ferrer seems very stiff and out of place against fine performances by Dietrich and Kennedy. I love this story and what you’re doing. Her renditions are not quite on the level of her "See What The Boys In The Backroom Will Have" from the western classic "Destry Rides Again" but are still captivating. ( Log Out /  Altar is shamed, and decides to give it all up. This is one of those arty European things that adds so much to the movie and makes watching it such a different experience from the average Western. Rancho Notorious is a gorgeous film, with beautiful Technicolor cinematography. With it being directed by the great Fritz Lang (a director with a great and distinctively Expressionistic visual and directing style, with 'M' and 'Metropolis' being two of the finest examples) and starring Marlene Dietrich (especially fond of her work with Josef von Sternberg and in 'Witness for the Prosecution'), 'Rancho Notorious' had a lot of interest value. “But Fritz finished the picture, and he told me he had turned it in at an hour and 45,” said Dan Taradash. Thanks for those kind words — and for pointing out the typo. I learned how to choreograph a script. It’s obvious it’s not cowboy geeks like us calling the shots! Fury, Clash by Night, The Woman in the Window, and The Big Heat were some of the ones that really stuck out for me. I’m very fond of this movie too, but then I’m a big fan of all Lang’s US movies. When he takes Altar her share of the proceeds, she finally informs him that Kinch gave her the jewelry. Kinch, the rapist/murderer, has a very small part and is a blatant coward. Synopsis: Vern Haskell, a nice rancher, seeks out to avenge his fiancé's death when she is killed during a robbery. I am in the minority on this one, but the film to me went from one cliché to another. He got very abusive to some of my camera crew.     |                         User Ratings Bat Masterson And Wyatt Earp Meet The Tingler. Everybody comes to Marlene's. Rancho Notorious is a 1952 American western film directed by Fritz Lang and starring Marlene Dietrich as the matron of a criminal hideout called Chuck-a-Luck. When the film was released, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times was critical of it, writing, "In the department of western action, the show has its interesting points, including a couple of fist-and-gun fights that have been racily staged by Fritz Lang. 60/100. But I am close to falling out with these guys’ — our producers — ‘and it would not surprise me if at some point I am off the picture. Certainly it has some good visuals, so at least one of Fritz Lang's trademark touches came through. ), Rancho Notorious was produced during Howard Hughes’ reign at RKO. The Western is so unique, so internalised, and so full of instantly-recognisable motifs, that many Westerns from the classic era take on the look and feel not of the western United States, but some surreal and separate country, as far removed from America as anywhere else. Kennedy was a great supporting actor, see is role as Vic Hansbro in "The Man From Laramie", or as Emerson Cole in "Bend of the River". She's fully in her philosophical mode here, like she was in Touch of Evil a few years later. Great pulp Western by the great Fritz Lang, Despite rich Technicolor and a heated performance from Dietrich...a mediocre western, Thrilling Western of murder , hate and revenge ; being compellingly directed by the great maestro Fritz Lang. Not a great picture, and one that is prodded along by a laughably corny folk ballad, though Lang does manage to come up with a few fresh twists on the genre and the supporting players are solid. When this movie was originally released ( 1951 ) as i recalled panned by the critics. I’m not a fan of the whole DVD-R thing, in theory, but I sure like the movies they’ve allowed me to see (and own). Sharp image. Arthur Kennedy's lead character, Vern Haskell, abandons a posse and sets out on a solo epic journey to track down the killer/rapist of his fiancé. However in keeping his cover, Haskell finds himself drawn into their world more and more. Most Movie Westerns try to avoid false images that betray their fictional accounts. By that time, RKO was in turmoil and producing very few films. When Vern finds that Frenchy has just been captured and is arrested in the local jail, he shoots bottles in a bar to be sent to jail. Vern is forced to go along on a bank robbery, during which one of the others, Kinch, secretly shoots at him. The score is a little overbearing and it just rarely rises above an ordinary western from the 1950's. Overall, though, Rancho Notorious is a great film, quite haunting in its own right. Arthur Kennedy plays Vern, a rancher whose fiancee is brutally raped and murdered. I called the ranch Chuck-A-Luck and there was a song throughout the film called ‘Chuck-A-Luck’…. The trail leads him to Frenchy Fairmont (Mel Ferrer) and Chuck-A-Luck, a retreat for outlaws run by Altar Keane (Dietrich). This was especially the case when the increasingly European production crews in Hollywood produced their skewed yet affectionate takes on this "most American of genres". Here Director Fritz Lang has no notions. One night, Vern notices that Altar is wearing a brooch that he gave to Beth. I’ve been nothing but pleased with those I’ve seen so far. I made it on the General Service lot; Howard Hughes financed it. Retitled Rancho Notorious by Howard Hughes, the film hit theaters in May 1952. “A few weeks later I ran into Howard Welsch, one of the producers, and asked how did he like it. He strode around the set in riding breeches and boots, a monocle in his eye, shouting orders in a German accent through his megaphone. As Lang told Peter Bogdanovich, “Originally, the picture was called Chuck-A-Luck, which is vertical roulette. With its reliance on simplistic camerawork, a silly plot somewhat borrowed from Lang’s Mabuse films, soundstages rather than the great outdoors, and the fact that Marlene Dietrich’s makeup seems to have been applied with a trowel (she was past 50), Rancho Notorious is an easy mark for someone looking to slam a great director. Vern's problem now is what to do...keep on his path of revenge or settle down with Altar and her feminine wiles. The technicolor is awful, Dietrich ( trying to repeat her so called success from Destry Rides Again ) awful, at 11 years later. Vern finds a bunch of men in residence, but has no idea if the killer is one of them. After questioning everyone he meets, Vern finally finds someone who lets slip that a woman named Altar Keane is connected with Chuck-a-luck. You would think the combination of Lang and Marlene Dietrich would be amazing, but this is my fourth viewing of the film over a 35 year period, and not once was I impressed with this movie. Watch this movie and you will see it happen, here. It was back when Criterion had just released Godard’s Le Mepris (Contempt), which when I saw is where I spotted the poster in the background. Personally, I love that song very much.”. In order to be able to work with Lang, I had to repress all the hatred and aversion he aroused in me. And even though I know it’s a really weird film, I don’t understand why people give it such a   hard time. She's so sad, so beautiful. 's Superman). Vern is locked with Frenchy and becomes his friend when he helps the hit-man to escape. “We had a very limited budget and decided to make everything in the studio.     |                         It's a fair story given an okay treatment. Howard prevailed upon me to stay — and Lang wanted to fire me, he wanted me to get off the picture. Fritz Lang a disappointment..period. It’s a cynical tale, full of cheats, hypocrites, bandits and murderers — not to mention a good man driven half crazy by hate. And he was literally working in every angle, over-the-shoulder shots, stuff like that. She also has a great musical number. We would sit at his house over his dreadful coffee (the worst I’ve ever tasted) and we’d go over the stuff I was writing. But he has been removed from the cast: no mention of his name. I made it on the General Service lot; Howard Hughes financed it. After they break out, Frenchy takes Vern to the Chuck-a-Luck, a horse ranch near the Mexican border owned by Altar. I’ve had the UK DVD of this for ages, and it’s pretty weak but I’m not a fan of the Archive so it looks like I’m stuck with it for now at least. ( Log Out /  If Mel Ferrer had not been there, I probably would have walked off the set in the middle of shooting. But the others you mentioned were definitely worthwhile. I cannot imagine the positive reviews I've read here about this movie. There's a gunslinger named "Frenchy Fairmont," and a warbly sung narrative song throughout reminding us that this is a tale of murder and revenge. Lang said, “What I wanted to show in Rancho Notorious was a young woman who owned a ranch, a sort of retreat for outlaws, opposed to a celebrated killer who had become too old to draw quickly.
