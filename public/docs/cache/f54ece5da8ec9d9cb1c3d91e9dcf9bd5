They are also called glory hunters; if they see another team is more successful, they go support that team. And that’s really the case with Real Madrid. The club also made money from sponsors like the Fly Emirates and Nike, who supply their kits. The club is one of the most active football clubs online with several blogs and forums in addition to their official website to communicate with their fans.

On social networks sites such as Facebook FC Bayern Munich has over 41 million Facebooks fans, 9.3 million Instagram followers, and 3.4 million twitter followers. It generated $751 million in revenue this year. However, whatever the number is, Man Utd have always valued their fans. They will have been gutted to lose Partey to Arsenal on transfer deadline day.
