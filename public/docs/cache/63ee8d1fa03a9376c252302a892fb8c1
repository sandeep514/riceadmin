The following passage has been often quoted in the literature. [11]  He used simple, everyday objects who may suddenly lose their familiar side, and become the messenger of beyond narcissism.

In early childhood this produces projections of multiple selves. B. Powered by. Keep up the great (and uncanny) work! Freud writes: “Jentsch says: ‘In telling a story, one of the most successful devices for easily creating uncanny effects is to leave the reader in uncertainty whether a particular figure in the story is a human being or an automaton; and to do it in such a way that his attention is not directly focused upon his uncertainty, so that he may not be urged to go into the matter and clear it up immediately, since that, as we have said, would quickly dissipate the peculiar emotional effect of the thing.

By contrasting the German adjective unheimlich with its base word heimlich ("concealed, hidden, in secret"), he proposes that social taboo often yields an aura not only of pious reverence but even more so of horror and even disgust, as the taboo state of an item gives rise to the commonplace assumption that that which is hidden from public eye (cf. Mori, M. (2019). Aesthetics and Psychoanalysis merged here. [...] In general we are reminded that the word heimlich is not unambiguous, but belongs to two sets of ideas, which, without being contradictory, are yet very different: on the one hand it means what is familiar and agreeable, and on the other, what is concealed and kept out of sight. heimlich, second definition = concealed, secret, withheld from sight and from others; secretive, deceitful = private.

AMBIVALENCE: The Double Doubled								The fact that an agency of this kind [the super-ego] exists, which is able to treat the rest of the ego like an object--the fact, that is, that man is capable of self-observation--renders it possible to invest the old idea of a double with a new meaning and to ascribe many things to it--above all, those things which seem to self-criticism to belong to the old surmounted narcissism of earlier times. My apologies to anyone this inconveniences, I wish I didn't have to do it. Reichardt, J. Lit. (see: Uncanny Valley) Also, doubt about whether a certain inanimate being is truly not living.

This lends some of the events the shimmer of the symbolic because it is undecidable whether they are real or imagined. Not everything that returns from repression is uncanny. [10] Lacan showed how the same image that seduces the subject, trapping him in the narcissistic impasse, may suddenly, by a contingency, show that it is dependent on something, some hidden object, and so the subject may grasp at the same time that he is not autonomous (5 December 1962). The self-blinding of the mythical criminal, Oedipus, was simply a mitigated form of the punishment of castration – the only punishment that was adequate for him by the lex talionis. I have a problem.

"[5] He expands upon its use in fiction: In telling a story one of the most successful devices for easily creating uncanny effects is to leave the reader in uncertainty whether a particular figure in the story is a human being or an automaton and to do it in such a way that his attention is not focused directly upon his uncertainty, so that he may not be led to go into the matter and clear it up immediately.[5].

It sees itself as stronger than reality; e.g. [12], This concept is closely related to Julia Kristeva's concept of abjection, where one reacts adversely to something forcefully cast out of the symbolic order. What interests us most in this long extract is to find that among its different shades of meaning the word heimlich exhibits one which is identical with its opposite, unheimlich. What is uncanny here is thus the return of something in our psychosexual history that has been overcome and forgotten.-- Freud's first thesis: The uncanny arises due to the return of repressed infantile material. This concept is closely related to Julia Kristeva's concept of abjection, where one reacts adversely to something forcefully cast out of the symbolic order. C. But Freud asks why our experience of the uncanny in our real-life experiences and in fiction are different. A. (See "Uncanny" 217). (See "Uncanny" 227)-- We, as readers of the fiction, must share the perspective of the character who experiences the uncanny event in the fictional world. A. Freud is not entirely satisfied with his own conclusion. In early childhood this produces projections of multiple selves. Abjection can be uncanny in that the observer can recognize something within the abject, possibly of what it was before it was 'cast out', yet be repulsed by what it is that caused it to be cast out to begin with. 3) The uncanny thus marks the return of the familiar in the sense of our psychic economy (in which nothing is ever lost or wholly forgotten). Our word, “uncanny” comes from the German word, “unheimlich,” which means, more or less, “the opposite of what is familiar.” Or, rather, “a mixture of the familiar and unfamiliar that is experienced as being peculiar.” (. But it is not only this latter material, offensive as it is to the criticism of the ego, which may be incorporated in the idea of a double. Doubt about whether a certain animate being is truly alive. (This is Freud's version of Jentsch's "intellectual uncertainty. Choose Your Own Adventure stories seem to be making a modest comeback thanks to tablets and smart phones. [...]’”, Doubt about whether one is dreaming or perhaps delirious, even insane, a doubt often brought on by a recurrence of “the same situations, things and events.”, “That factor which consists in a recurrence of the same situations, things and events, will perhaps not appeal to everyone as a source of uncanny feeling. And finally there is the constant recurrence of similar situations, a same face, or character-trait, or twist of fortune, or a same crime, or even a same name recurring throughout several consecutive generations.” [2], Other instances of ‘the double’ are reflections in mirrors, shadows, guardian spirits and, arguably, the belief in the soul. But this rupture is also related with the accuracy and detail of objective narration. B. It forms the hub, or center of all events. ): Robots and art: Exploring an unlikely symbiosis.
