Read Common Sense Media's Sleuth (2007) review, age rating, and parents guide. Swear words (including "f--k") and other inflammatory language are hurled like weapons; later, actual weapons (including guns and knives) are brandished. "[30] Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press, criticised the performances by the lead actors, saying, "We're left with two suitably hammy performances by Caine and Law, who do not forget they are actors playing actors"[citation needed], Leonard Maltin, who rated the original film 4 out of 4 stars, gave this version a "BOMB" rating, the lowest rating he has ever given a Branagh film, stating that the new version "has every ounce of entertainment drained from it" and called the film "unbelievably bad". (...) As directed by Kenneth Branagh, this new version is darker and more claustrophobic. His first surprise is learning that the comfortable old English country house is, on the inside, cold and stark and filled with monitors, cameras and other surveillance devices. This was the second time Law performed a film character originated by Caine, the first having been the title role of Alfie. The film's screenwriter, Harold Pinter, credited as "Man on TV", is seen on a television in the background interviewing another man, played by an uncredited Kenneth Branagh. "[12] Custom designed furniture from Ron Arad completes the look. But just like Alfie, Sleuth is a little too slick. They do so by playing mental games, with the battles quickly turning violent. Common Sense and other associated names and logos are trademarks of Common Sense Media, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization (FEIN: 41-2024986). It looks like we don't have a Synopsis for this title yet. "[27], Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, "It's no mystery that 'Sleuth' is fascinating," observing that Pinter "has written a new country house mystery, which is not really a mystery at all in terms of its plot, and eerily impenetrable in its human relationship" and that "in 'Sleuth' what [Kenneth Branagh] celebrates is perplexing, ominous, insinuating material in the hands of two skilled actors. Gary Hume did all the artwork on the walls. Our ratings are based on child development best practices. It didn't feel like a remake. He embellishes the screenplay’s every obvious conceit and word, hammering the point until you feel as if you’re trapped inside the elevator with Milo and Andrew, going up and down and up and down, though nowhere in particular. And then everything else was drawn from contemporary British architecture, contemporary British artists. Life On Mars: the ending posed more questions than it answered. Parents Guide. ". Parents need to know that this sleek, adult-oriented thriller tackles mature themes -- infidelity, violence, murder -- from the get-go. “The minimalism I found was a great challenge. Branagh's version has more incipient horror and less camp. Andrew claims he wants to be rid of his now-detested wife. Common Sense Media's unbiased ratings are created by expert reviewers and aren't influenced by the product's creators or by any of our funders, affiliates, or partners. Lots, though nothing gory. Then they do a dance of deception, a veritable tango. Characters drink whiskey and other hard liquor; in one painfully humiliating scene, Milo guzzles alcohol straight from the bottle. Part of the 'fun' of the film is seeing Jude Law play this other character so convincingly. Based on a play by Anthony Shaffer (which was first turned into a movie in 1972 starring Caine) this remake penned by Nobel laureate Harold Pinter and directed by Kenneth Branagh examines what happens when Wyke summons Tindle to his country home for a tête-à-tête. [23], On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 122 reviews with an average rating of 5.13/10. "[5], The screenwriter, actors and director insisted that this Sleuth was not a "remake. "[citation needed], Claudia Puig of USA Today was more appreciative, writing, "Caine and Law are in fine form bantering cleverly in this entertaining cat-and-mouse game, thanks to the inspired dialogue of Harold Pinter. If you've seen the 1970s original, you can compare and contrast the two. On his sprawling country estate, an aging writer matches wits with the struggling actor who has stolen his wife's heart. The remote control for them looks like an iPod Nano. In the original the house where all the action took place was Gothic and laden with gewgaws. When Wyke invites Tindle to his mansion, Tindle seeks to convince the former into letting his wife go by signing the divorce paper. The critical consensus states that "Sleuth is so obvious and coarse, rather than suspenseful and action-packed, that it does nothing to improve on the original version. According to many accounts, this set out to be a remake of the 1972 version, but Pinter's screenplay-offered "a fresh take" on Shaffer's play and "a very different form" from the original film. On his sprawling country estate, an aging writer matches wits with the struggling actor who has stolen his wife's heart. There isn't a single line in it that was in the other one, and Pinter had never seen the [1972] movie. Milo Tindle comes to him with a strange request, that Mr. Wyke divorce his wife so that Tindle can marry her. The elevator was Harold's idea, so that was there and was a central feature of what we are going to bring to it. "[7] Law further felt that he "was creating a character (Tindle), I wasn't recreating one. At his country estate, a writer matches wits with an actor who has stolen his wife's heart involving mind games and tricks. There aren't any reviews yet. After premiering at the 64th Venice Film Festival on 30 August 2007,[5] Sleuth was screened at the Toronto Film Festival on 10 September 2007. Caine had previously starred in a 1972 version, where he played Law's role against Laurence Olivier. Andrew Wyke, an aging famous author who lives alone in a high-tech mansion, after his wife Maggie has left him for a younger man; and Milo Tindle, an aspiring actor, equipped with charm and wit, who demonstrates both qualities once again. Join now.     |                         Heavy emphasis on high-tech gadgets (though labels aren't easily identifiable). Winner takes all -- though what "all" means is left up for debate. All rights reserved. Two extremely clever British men are in a game of trickery and deceit. [26], Time film reviewer Richard Corliss indicated he was not pleased with the outcome, concluding, "...[I]f you consider what the exalted quartet of Branagh, Pinter, Caine and Law might have done with the project, and what they did to it, Sleuth has to be the worst prestige movie of the year. In the 2007 film, Caine took the role of Wyke, and Law took Caine's role of Tindle.[3]. Caine taps a deep reservoir of rage not seen in his films in ages; Law, on the other hand, buries his pretty-boy image -- Milo is rough and desperate and, though handsome to behold, unafraid to be ugly (in one scene, he transforms "wit" into a loaded, almost shameful, word). In the build-up to the 16th and final episode of Life On Mars, all the talk centred on the ending.Unavoidably so.
