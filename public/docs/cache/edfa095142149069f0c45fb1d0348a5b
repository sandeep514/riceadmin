</html>";s:4:"text";s:10789:"<p>I'm someone with a strong suspension of disbelief but some of the mechanics of the deaths were straight up absurd. 					 A for effort, ** 1/2 overall. To say Rene Daalder's film was ahead of its time would be an understatement as it's basically a social drama with many horror elements thrown in. First, it occurs when Mark and Theresa learn David’s explosive scheme, whereupon they inform him they won’t leave the building, so he’ll have to kill them, too—while they’re defiantly dancing. </p> <p>Unsubscribe at any time. A weird introduction, you see something bad went down. New guy at school David objects to the bullies pushing people down, calling the girls names and planning to rape them, and destroying the smart kid’s only means of transport for fun. </p> <p>Nick Groff Investigates... October Horror Movie Madness! At last, a pitch-black antidote to John Hughes and his “aspirational” suburban soul poison had arrived to force drain cleaner down the throat of Ferris Bueller, blast lethal holes through the empty hearts of Duckie and Farmer Ted, and blow the fully occupied Breakfast Club detention center into pristine smithereens. February 16, 2020 At the most basic level, showing the never ending cycle of power, how men can be like weeds. MASSACRE AT CENTRAL HIGH (1976) ... (1982) and Heathers (1990), what helps set Massacre at Central High apart from the standard exploitationer is the assured direction and intelligent, thoughtful screenplay by Renne Daalder (whom at one point was rumoured to be a woman). 					TMDb Death Wish + Animal Farm + Dazed & Confused + The Old Testament = This. He is a man of principle, but blind hatred distorts even that to the point of homicide. </p> <p>Darted in Your Armchair: The Tubes in What Do You Want From Life? The college party Veronica and Heather attend is held at Remington University. In Heathers the clique bullies the student body mostly through vicious pranks. . [7] Daalder had been recommended to producers Jerome Bauman, and Harold Sobel by Russ Meyer, for whom Daalder had written an unproduced script. Then people start dying one by one... but that's when interesting stuff starts to happen. And when David steps in to help those being picked on one too many times, he becomes their new target. Sources stating that Ebert included the film in his annual "Top 10" list appear to be a confusion with Canby, as Ebert did not publish a written review of the film. One alternate ending had Martha Dumptruck stabbing Veronica. Whether by design or by accident (when you're sitting in the dark watching the final product, how important is this distinction anyway?) Fireworks or mushroom clouds ensue, depending on the point from which you view Ground Zero. Honest, it's just laying there, a mass of smoking wreckage. Oh, the (finally recognizable as human) humanity! The suspense is how each one will die, and where will David draw the line? When Barbara Ann frets over her grades in Botany—renamed “Plant Skills for Living”—Alan unleashes her on fidgety principal Weldon Emmett (Harvey Korman,) to work the same wiles on him that got her pop to shell out for not a dozen but, in fact, 13 cashmere sweaters. Seriously, the main kid who decides to take matters into his own hands is very, very monotone throughout, but it plays less like a style choice than just that the guy playing him can't act. Got called Rudolf that Christmas. The other students feel so marginalized that they tolerate the abuse and accept it…, Yeah this is pretty terrible...i don't get how its as well regarded as it is by my friends that I follow here. The movie starts off with a familiar premise, where the new kid in school is taken in by a squad of jock kids, then starts to distance himself when he learns they are all bullies. The plot follows a series of revenge killings at a fictional American high school, after which the oppressed students take on the role of their bully oppressors. That's what education is all about. They're both about vicious high school cliques. Coming off the triumphs of writing The Seven Year Itch (1955), Bus Stop (1956), Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? </p> <p>That pool dive, oh smack! With its shared themes of vicious girl cliques and murderous outcasts getting revenge, the film was described by many critics as 1980s version of. ), Jaws boat to return on the 45th year anniversary of the movie. </p> <p>Barbara Ann is last depicted as a name-above-the-title starlet in T. Harrison Belmont’s Bikini Widow. A bullying PSA disguised as a disappointing horror movie. The Hollywood Reporter actually offered the media’s most even-handed denouncement of the series in describing its script-flipping milieu as “a dark and almost reactionary undercurrent in which the disenfranchised aren’t being bullied, but rather are wielding identity politics and political correctness as weapons”. It is really pretty scary that in this modern society, we hear about school violence much too often. Massacre at Central High was written and directed by Rene Daalder in his second feature-film effort, having previously directed the 1969 Dutch drama film De blanke slavin (Trans: The White Slave). Principal photography commenced in early 1976 over a three week period in Los Angeles and Malibu. More specifically, it’s Lord Love a Duck (released at a time when much of Generation X was being born) into Massacre at Central High (released in the year of the Bicentennial, an indelible Gen X memory) into Heathers (released just as Generation X was finally shattering the shackles of adolescence). Featuring elements which were latter put to use in films like Class of 1984 (1982) and Heathers (1990), what helps set Massacre at Central High apart from the standard exploitationer is the assured direction and intelligent, thoughtful screenplay by Renne Daalder (whom at one point was rumoured to be a woman). Throughout the 1970s and ’80s, both Lord Love a Duck (1966) and Massacre at Central High (1976) routinely played midnight shows and revival houses, exuding a similarly punkish energy and righteous nihilism to savvy audiences. It’s an interesting story concept, just not with this cast and crew. </p> <p>Just Heathers. Lord Love a Duck climaxes with a heavy machinery attack on a commencement ceremony; Massacre and Heathers both culminate with a scheme to set off explosives at a crowded dance in a school gym. The other students feel so marginalized that they tolerate the abuse and accept it…, Yeah this is pretty terrible...i don't get how its as well regarded as it is by my friends that I follow here. It’s a shame that Dave wants nothing to do with them. </p> <p>				 The big difference with the two movies is the gender of the bully clique; in Heathers they are female, in Massacre they are male. Not for nothing has it endured as a vital rite-of-passage for multiple generations of adolescents who become worthwhile adults. </p> <p>Sweet Home (10/4) 2. Also, there's a foreign version called Sexy Jeans, that I managed to…. All the films from my exploitation lists, bundled into one mega-super-list-to-rule-them-all! The film's director, Rene Daalder, described Massacre at Central High as "eerily predicting punk and Columbine". Winona Ryder has said she was motivated to make this movie because of her strong feelings about girl cliques, the pervasive bullying that goes on in high schools and the "hellishness" of the high school experience. The clique in Massacre at Central High is a villainous group of four boys who rule Central High. </p> <p>He tells Theresa they must prevent David from killing more people at the school dance with a bomb he has planted in the school basement. Charlie, that's terrible. To save David's reputation, Mark and Theresa agree to tell the police that Spoony, Mary, and Jane had planted the bomb, and that David had given his life to save everyone. 					 MASSACRE AT CENTRAL HIGH (1976) THE TICKET! [13][Note 2] Dave Sindelar from Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings praised the film's characters, political subtext, and depth, while criticizing some of the dialogue, and soundtrack. It was later released by Black Horse on September 27, 2004, and Desert Island Films on February 18, 2012. The school changes after the bullies' deaths. 					 Mobile site. Seriously, the main kid who decides to take matters into his own hands is very, very monotone throughout, but it plays less like a style choice than just that the guy playing him can't act. They’re not in charge either. David doesn't play by their rules so soon he becomes a target, which leads to many deaths. "[14] TV Guide gave the film three out of five stars, writing, "Massacre at Central High is a fascinating little movie that delivers its expected exploitation thrills while presenting a political allegory, albeit a somewhat confused one. This phrase was first coined by the American radio reporter Herbert O. Morrison during his May 6, 1937, on-the-spot description of the explosion of the Hindenburg in New Jersey. Thankfully, nudity was plentiful in the Seventies. The sound is muffled when Heather Chandler dies indoors, is more obvious when Curt and Ram are killed in the forest, and is quite loud after JD blows up. Picasso, Goya, and The Imagery of Suffering. In Massacre the clique bullies the school by literally beating everyone up and threatening them. SCENE THAT WILL HAVE HER/HIM JUMPING IN YOUR ARMS! Blood & Black Lace (10/18) 4.…, Andrew Liverod 11,876 films  406  17  Edit. Gosh! He also told LAT that he had grown tired of Hollywood's romanticization of suicide, and that he believed most people actually harbor an "ultimate fantasy" of attending their own funeral.". Carrying a lot of that burnt celluloid southern california atmosphere ripe for the drive in ala Toolbox Murders, Slithis, and Drive-In Massacre, Central High forgoes really any slashing or sleazy murder to be enjoyed and instead opts for an incredibly long winded revenge set up which unfolds into a decently neat, recursive twist midway through that somehow also feels flat by the end. </p> <p>Would you rather have 15 seconds of surprise, or 15 minutes of suspense?
