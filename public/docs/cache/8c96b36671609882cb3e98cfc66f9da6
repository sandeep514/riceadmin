Plastic recorders tend to have a harsher, more ‘plasticky’ sound than their wooden counterparts - and plastic whistles shre this plasticky harshness with them. Good luck with it all, The fiddle, the recorder and the six-hole wooden flute were standard instruments of baroque “classical” music. However, that does not mean that the notes are smaller or even nearer to each other. My guess of why this tradition continues is that the recorder is a well-known instrument (similar to the tin whistle) that is very easy to produce sound, but requires time and practice to make beautiful music (just like any serious instrument). The shape of the embrouchure hole is quite different on the whistle compared to the recorder- also the fact that your recorder is made from wood will mean it has a hugely different tone from any whistle that you get. This shouldn’t make your decision completely, since either can fit in many types of music. But in my book, music isn’t about being purist, but about having fun and playing great music. but most whistles are made of some sort of metal, usually brass, and thus have a unique timbre. Hello. Concert Flute, Recorder, Tin Whistle, Fife. As long as the traditional stuff survives in decent health, does it matter if other people prefer  the plasticized stuff? Another major difference between tin whistles and recorders are the number of notes that the instruments can play.

However: that doesn’t mean that it can’t at all suit the character of Irish Traditional Music. emelinebel, This makes it easy to teach kids the different notes because it requires little effort to go from “never-played-an-instrument-before” to “know-how-to-make-noise-with-a-recorder.”.

Granted it is more flexible as far as having virtual full ability to play whatever key you need (thanks to the thumb hole).

It never made it into the classical period though, because of its limitations in dynamics - as with a whistle, you can’t really do forte and piano on a recorder without affecting pitch, but flexible dynamics became more and more important then, so the traverse flute slowly took over and the recorder was all but lost, surviving only in some regions (Bohemia for instance) as a folk instrument, until Arnold Dolmetsch built new recorders, using surviving historical recorders as models, and started a whole new recorder revival, which had some unfortunate results, like the misguided notion that the recorder is an easy starter instrument for kids, which it is in a certain sense - you can produce a note instantly – but in others really isn’t – it takes great skill and practice to produce a BEAUTIFUL note and most players don’t get there in the first place.
