(They are not, incidentally, the first to have done this. “Pale Fire,” Vladimir Nabokov’s resplendent rare bird of a novel, comes with its own commentary built in. And, as a rhyming novella, there’s really no question who wrote it. Pale Fire, Canto One Summary The poem "Pale Fire" begins with a metaphor of Shade as a bird crashing into the reflection in a window pane, but then flying on into the illusory sky. Aghast, Kinbote sets about reinstating all the precious material excluded by Shade. “Oh, I did not expect him to devote himself completely to that theme!” writes Kinbote, trying to choke back his anguish on realizing that Shade’s poem, an essentially autobiographical meditation on time, memory, and the afterlife, makes no mention of Zembla and its deposed monarch. The new edition, housed in a deluxe, cloth-bound, fold-out box, also contains a “facsimile” of Shade’s manuscript which accords with the description Kinbote provides in his foreword: “eighty medium-sized index cards, on each of which Shade reserved the pink upper line for headings (canto number, date) and used the fourteen light-blue lines for writing with a fine nib in a minute, tidy, remarkably clear hand, the text of his poem, skipping a line to indicate double space, and always using a fresh card to begin a new canto.”. <br> <br>Photograph of Nabokov by Horst Tappe/Pix Inc./Time Life Pictures/Getty Images. Only the novel makes it a poem by Shade; without the Commentary, the poem could only be by Nabokov. Nabokov’s “Pale Fire” fractures the traditional doppelganger story (as do other novels of his, such as “Despair,” “The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,” and “Lolita”), which often relies on clear black-and-white doubles (Stevenson’s “Dr. The New Yorker may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers. He began to write in English, which brought him a new audience and increased his renown. This clear and detailed 48-page reading guide is structured as follows: Pale Fire takes the form of a poem in four cantos by the great American poet John Shade, accompanied by an extensive commentary by his editor Charles Kinbote, an exile from the country of Zembla, which has just been rocked by a violent revolution. Given the ludic vitality of Kinbote’s portions of the book, it is not surprising that Shade’s subtle, meticulously wrought poem should have received short shrift. (“Pale Fire” was published in 1962.)

Although he was born in Russia, during the Revolution he was forced to flee to Europe, where he studied literature, wrote his first books and gained recognition as a Russian-speaking author. <br> <br>Analysis.  	Biography of Vladimir Nabokov “Pale Fire,” Vladimir Nabokov’s resplendent rare bird of a novel, comes with its own commentary built in. Dan Chiasson, The New Yorker’s poetry critic and himself a feted poet, was not convinced: “Part of Nabokov’s seriously irritating genius is to have baited the hook with a poem that people would be tempted to praise, even to praise over ‘real’ Modern poems.   	Genre Although he was born in Russia, during the Revolution he was forced to flee to Europe, where he studied literature, wrote his first books and gained recognition as a Russian-speaking author.

Some books, like “The Institutionalist Approach to Public Utility Regulation,” defeat commentary; others, like “Ulysses,” invite it. It provides a thorough exploration of the novel’s plot, characters and main themes, as well as a useful discussion of its innovative form.   	Charles Kinbote Pale Fire takes the form of a poem in four cantos by the great American poet John Shade, accompanied by an extensive commentary by his editor Charles Kinbote, an exile from the country of Zembla, which has just been rocked by a violent revolution. His failure to do so has little to do with the quality of the poem; it is more a function of a period during which American poetry was in the process of redefining itself.”, I did some canvassing to see what the literati made of such claims. It was a novelist, Arthur Phillips, who had the most enthusiastic words for Shade. <br> <br>The resultant “commentary”—which includes a hair-raising narrative of the king’s escape across Zembla’s Bera mountain range, a blow-by-blow account of a bungled assassination plot, learned asides on Zemblan history (with special focus on the members of its royal family), and plenty else besides—is perhaps the most entertaining two hundred pages of fiction ever written. Pale Fire is ostensibly the text of a poem of the same name by John Shade, with introduction and commentary provided by Charles Kinbote, as well as a supplementary index. His fame exploded on a global scale with the publication of Lolita, his best-known novel, and he is now considered to be one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. Here are the famous opening lines, which reveal the writer’s imagination in full flight and, among other things, give us a catalogue of some of nature’s most artful pranks: I was the shadow of the waxwing slainBy the false azure in the windowpane;I was the smudge of ashen fluff—and ILived on, flew on, in the reflected sky.And from the inside, too, I’d duplicateMyself, my lamp, an apple on a plate:Uncurtaining the night, I’d let dark glassHang all the furniture above the grass,And how delightful when a fall of snowCovered my glimpse of lawn and reached up soAs to make chair and bed exactly standUpon that snow, out in that crystal land! He later moved to the USA, and became an American citizen in 1945. A master of the list, Nabokov shrewdly saves the best detail for last, and yet everything here is a keeper.

And, as such, it deserves to be published on its own, as a poem by Nabokov. “It might have been blended of course with some of his own life stuff and sundry Americana—but I was sure his poem would contain the wonderful incidents I had described to him, the characters I had made alive for him and the unique atmosphere of my kingdom.”.  Even without the marvels of the novel “Pale Fire,” the poem “Pale Fire” is a little novel in itself.

Occasionally it shows a weakness for what Nabokov, in an earlier novel, called “the doubtful splendors of virtuosity.” It is hard not to feel in the following passage, for example, that the razor-blade commercial is just a pretext for the burnished ingenuity of Nabokov’s description of it: I have my doubts about the one-armed blokeWho in commercials with one gliding strokeClears a smooth path of flesh from ear to chin,Then wipes his face and fondly tries his skin. A typical note begins: Line 130: I never bounced a ball or swung a bat. <br> The commentary may constitute the main attraction, but as this lavish new edition reminds us, the poem is itself a doozy that bristles with all the humor, yearning, pathos, and metaphysical wit that have become synonymous with Nabokov’s name.

The novel Pale Fire is a book of mirrors, and "Pale Fire" the poem is likewise fascinated by reflections.

Frankly I too never excelled in soccer and cricket; I am a passable horseman, a vigorous though unorthodox skier, a good skater, a tricky wrestler, and an enthusiastic mountain climber. Charles Kinbote). <br> <br>As a young child, the poet was fascinated by the mirror-image likeness of the living room, and he would "duplicate" himself looking at his reflection in the window. He saw a waxwing bird "slain" by running into a plate glass window, perhaps when he was still a boy.
