At last, the "Alderson Drive" "-- NASA physicist Harold White says that by tweaking the drive used, the amount of energy may be able to be compressed from something the size of 300 Earths into something that weighs only 1,600 pounds. Military ships usually travel under constant acceleration, which saves time, but consumes vast amounts of fuel. There is no magic way from, say, Saturn to Earth: you have to slog across. Energy is used. The 3,973 sq. <br> <br>Something does not work as expected? More on that in a moment. <br> In order for your construct to go into and emerge from the continuum universe without change you must have some complex machinery to hold everything together and prevent your ship—and crew—from being disorganized into elementary particles. Once in a star system you must rely on reaction drives to get around. <br> <br>Release a marble on one hill and it will roll down, across the saddle, and up the side of the other. When you travel in the continuum universe you continually lose kinetic energy; it "leaks." ft. single-family home is a 4 bed, 4.0 bath property. Even at constant high acceleration, crossing a system can take weeks. <br> <br>Wikidot.com Terms of Service - what you can, what you should not etc. Take your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat. <br> <br>Human astrogators apparently lack the requisite instincts and precision, but Motie engineers are capable of this. Stress-Free Car-Shopping Here at Alderson Auto Group, it is our mission to be the automotive home of drivers in the Lubbock, TX area. The force has little effect in our universe and is barely detectable. Has the nice benefit of keeping space travel lengthy and difficult, but not so long or so hard that the PCs won't want to travel anywhere. You may travel by using it, but only along precisely defined lines of equipotential flux: tramways or tramlines. <br> <br>Possible tramlines lie between each two stars, but they don't always exist, because when you add third and fourth stars to the system they may interfere, so there is no unique gradient line. <br> <br>That delay and distraction, combined with the fact that each star system had only a handful of Alderson Points, meant it was entirely possible to ambush space craft as they came out of the Alderson Tramline. I Know What You Did Last Summer (2016 Remake), The Death Of Batman (Batman: Wrath Of The Villains), https://fanon.fandom.com/wiki/Alderson_Drive?oldid=37412. The location of an Alderson point is dictated by the balance of the fundamental forces, which for a Sol-like star leads to points that can be several astronomical units apart by direct line – even farther when orbital paths are taken into account. Travel across the galaxy can thus be achieved by little hops from one system to another, followed by a few weeks of repositioning within a given stars system. General Wikidot.com documentation and help section. Within that universe particles may travel as fast as they can be accelerated; and the fifth force exists to accelerate them. See pages that link to and include this page. The intersection will have a "pass," a region higher than the low points where the rocks (stars) lie, but lower than the general level of the rubber sheet. Notify administrators if there is objectionable content in this page. Dan Alderson helped Pournelle work out the notional science behind the drive, and how it should work to be a useful plot device. <br> <br>Imagine the universe as a thin rubber sheet, very flat.  <br> <br>However, in all but the most fortuitous alignments of Alderson points, the ship will have to change direction upon arrival in the destination system, requiring significantly more acceleration than after a jump at rest and resulting in very little time saved overall. The "continuum univese" differs from the one we're used to in that there are no known quantum effects there. The Alderson Drive is a type of Shortcut Drive used in some novels by Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven. Within that universe particles may travel as fast as they can be accelerated; and the fifth force exists to accelerate them. <br> <br>As Alderson points can be difficult to find, even when their position is known in principle, human astrogators bring their ships to as near a complete stop as they can, enabling them to precisely determine their position before jumping.  <br>The force has little effect in our universe; in fact, it is barely detectable. <br> <br>And these limitations mean that spaceships cannot sneak up on a planet and attack it. This site has been visited:  <br> <br>Star systems and planets can be thought of as continents and islands, then, and Alderson Points as narrow sea gates such as Suez, Gibraltar, Panama, Malay Straits, etc. <br> <br>Or could inspire something similar in other settings. The Alderson Drive is not technically an "FTL drive", but it achieves the same affects. There won't be more than five or six possible points of entry, and there may only be one. The Alderson drive, named after Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist Dan Alderson, is a fictional device that enables instantaneous interstellar transportation. You must also have zero kinetic energy relative to a complex set of coordinates that we won't discuss here. The Alderson Drive is used in The Mote In God's Eye by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, and the CoDominium series by Jerry Pournelle. <br> <br>Check out how this page has evolved in the past.

List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction, Queen Taramis A Witch Shall Be Born Conan the Destroyer, https://mavericuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Alderson_drive?oldid=3897. Spacecraft are thus vulnerable to attack until their occupants recover from jump shock. <br> <br>This can be detected in our universe as photons. <br> <br>Maveric Universe Wiki is a FANDOM Movies Community. These points (and the resulting "tramlines") occur naturally, connecting stars. The route from one star to another through that "pass" is the tramline. To emerge from the continuum universe you must exit with precisely the same potential energy (measured in terms of the fifth force, not gravity) as you entered. Thus space battles are possible, and you can't escape battle by vanishing into "hyperspace." But getting to other worlds and stars still ain't easy. Traditionally there were four known forces in modern physics: two subnuclear forces responsible respectively for alpha and beta decay; electromagnetism, which includes light; and gravity. When you do this you turn yourself into a correspondence particle; go across the tramline; and come out at the point on the other side where your potential energy is equal to what you entered with, plus zero kinetic energy (in terms of the fifth force and complex reference axes). Find out what you can do. Alderson points are difficult to find. The Alderson Drive allows spaceships to travel from star system to star system instantaneously. You can get from one universe to another. If you want to discuss contents of this page - this is the easiest way to do it. In modern physics, four forces are known: gravity, electromagnetism, nuclear weak, and nuclear strong. <br> <br>To get from the quantum to the continuum universe you must supply power, and this is available only in quantum terms. The Alderson drive is not, strictly, a faster-than-light drive: it can more nearly be likened to a device able to use a form of wormhole, whose entry and exit 'Alderson points'  are at the ends of an 'Alderson tramline'. View wiki source for this page without editing. <br> <br>It is featured in the " CoDominium " series of science fiction novel s by Jerry Pournelle, including the "Mote" series by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Eventually, scientists lead by physicist Dan Alderson at the California Institute of Technology detected a fifth force. <br> <br>That too is a tramline effect. The fictional science behind the Alderson drive assumes a fifth force, generated by thermonuclear reactions. <br> <br>Append content without editing the whole page source. For FTL communications, the simplest solution given the existing Alderson system would indeed be Alderson couriers- your "space pony express". So basically, to get to another star system, you "just" have to travel very close to our sun and find the wormhole connecting it to another star. How soon could NASA come up with a feasible drive like this? You may also imagine stars to be like hills; move another star close and the hills will intersect. A possible alternative, discussed in The Gripping Hand is to reach the point at speed and activate the drive at precisely the right time. <br> <br>Of course they cannot emerge into our universe at such speeds: they have to lose their energy to emerge at all. Maybe the energy required to power an Alderson swap increases with the size and mass of the object being transported. Instead, the Alderson Drive locates and utilizes a particular form of wormhole known as an Alderson Point. Within the novels, the Alderson Drive had an unfortunate side-effect of being very disorienting to human passengers and to automated systems.

CoDominium is a series of future history  novels written by American writer Jerry Pournelle, along with several co-authors, primarily Larry Niven. Again, from summit to summit there will be one and only one line that preserves the maximum potential energy for that level. <br> <br>The Mote civilizations had long been able to construct an Alderson-type drive but, because they had no Langston Field technology, their many attempts to use the drive always failed: their unshielded ships making a jump were burnt up by the red giant's photosphere. As a result, it may be faster to make several jumps through other systems with points in close proximity than to cross a single system whose points are far apart. Watch headings for an "edit" link when available. As with any Shortcut Drive, movement in the local frame of reference does not exceed that of light. We provide a vast selection of new and used vehicles, exceptional car care and customer service with a smile! <br> <br>The Alderson Point wormholes are difficult to find, spaced far apart, utilize the Fifth Force, and only exist between points in space with the same thermodynamic potential. To reach a given planet, one must enter its stellar system at an Alderson point and travel across it at sub-light speeds. Simultaneously with the discovery of the fifth force, was the discovery of a second universe in point-to-point congruence with our own. <br> <br>Also, the "jump shock" disorientation, and the potential for ambush allows for some tactical challenges and plot devices. Alderson tramlines form between points of equipotential thermonuclear flux located near stars. Comments Share The Alderson Drive is a device that enables instantaneous interstellar transportation in the CoDominium book series of science fiction novels by Jerry Pournelle. Click here to edit contents of this page. The Alderson drive, named after Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist Dan Alderson, is a fictional device that enables instantaneous interstellar transportation. To reach a given planet you must travel across its stellar system, and you must enter that system at one of the Alderson Points. Its inner end is well above the plane of the local ecliptic and its outer end appears inside the photosphere of a red giant star. This "Alderson force" is generated by thermonuclear reactions. Alderson tramlines, when they form, form instantaneously, and travel between them appears to take no elapsed time. If you want to make it less of a hassle, you'll need some additional mechanic. At the beginning of The Mote in God's Eye, only one tramline leads to Mote system. <br> <br>You enter from the quantum universe. However, there are limitations on what the Drive can do. If this seems confusing, don't spend a lot of time worrying about it; we'll get to the effects of all this in a moment. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:14:"alderson drive";s:5:"links";s:5584:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/texas-christian-university-online-86e6ec'>Texas Christian University Online</a>,
