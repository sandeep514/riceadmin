(Padraic H Pearse), in oration at funeral    in Glasnevin of Fenian Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, August 1, 1915. Joe Cahill authorised the beginning of the IRA's bombing operations as well as attacks on troops and the RUC. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) is an Irish republican paramilitary organisation whose aim was to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and bring about a socialist republic within a united Ireland by force of arms and political persuasion. Ryan, 32, was the leader of the Dublin brigade of the Real IRA – one of the breakaway groups opposed to Northern Ireland’s peace process. [7]  From the start, there was intermittent feuding between McKee's men and his former comrades in the Official IRA, as they vied for control of nationalist areas. I often include your blog in my Always Interesting section. As such it has played a role in the transnational movements associated with the campaigns for various forms of Irish independence. In the aftermath of the 1969 Northern Ireland riots, many republicans in Belfast felt that the IRA had let down the city's Catholic and nationalist community by failing to prevent the assault and burning of Catholic streets by loyalists. In the Belfast Brigade's Second Battalion alone, for example, twenty IRA volunteers were killed in the twelve months after August 1971. While roughly 50 fought on the Republican side. Indeed, the majority of the Scottish Brigade from the War of Independence, including much of the more active portion, backed the Treaty.[32]. In the ensuing five-hour gun battle, McKee was wounded and one of his men was killed, along with at least four Protestants. In terms of post-Rising activism, all, including McGalloghly were involved in re-organising the Volunteers upon their release in late 1916 and early 1917. [10], The other set of brothers, the McGalloghlys, were Lanarkshire born. Sean MacStiofain, the IRA chief of staff, formally announced the end of the ceasefire that night, in response to events in Belfast. (Eighteen of these convictions were overturned on appeal on 17 July 1986.) Most IRA activity in Scotland involved fund raising and gun running, but there was also a celebrated ambush of police van in Glasgow in 1921. The Brigade became involved in the July 1997 clashes triggered by the Drumcree conflict. Robinson stated that he had been trying to start a guerrilla war, he did not think that the war had ended at the surrender in 1916, rather he felt that this was the same war that had been ongoing since 1172 (i.e. In the 1980s, the Belfast Brigade was hard hit by the use of supergrass informers. [1], On 22 September, McKee and a number of other IRA men, arrived armed at a meeting called by McMillen and tried to oust him as head of the Belfast IRA. After Truce, he was commissioned in Free State Army. Séamus Robinson’s brother, Joe, along with the man he was arrested with in 1916, Séamus Reader, were leading figures in the Scottish Brigade of the Irish Volunteers/IRA between their release in 1917 and 1921. "They think they have pacified Ireland. The McGalloghly brothers had left the Clydeside unit of the Volunteers in 1917 following the split that had been engendered by arguments over the senior Scottish Republicans opposition to the Rising. Formation Edit. Five of those who had grown up in Ireland were from Dublin. The loyalist Ulster Defence Association in turn threatened to burn the houses if they were occupied by Catholics. Still, always a fresh generation    has passed on to withstand the same opposition . The Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA was the largest of the organisation's brigades, based in the city of Belfast. The ensuing feud led to the deaths of 11 republican paramilitaries and a number of nationalist civilians, such as the head of the Falls Road taxi association, whose business was affiliated with the Provisionals. This list includes members of the Provisional IRA as well as subsequent splinter groups including the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA. The British Army proceeded to build fortified posts in republican west Belfast, thus hampering the IRA's freedom of movement. [19] Often referred to as Sandy or Alec, Carmichael had been prominent during the arms raids of 1915 and was a company captain from 1917, having played a leading role in the re-organisation of the Volunteers in Glasgow after the mass release of prisoners from Frongoch in late 1916.[20]. In the ensuing five-hour gun battle, McKee was wounded and one of his men was killed, along with at least four Protestants. [21] Moreover, the Belfast Brigade changed its tactics in an effort to avoid the heavy losses in killed and captured they had suffered up to that point. Firstly, they ousted Billy McKee as OC of the Belfast Brigade, accusing him of demoralising and discrediting the IRA by allowing it to become involved in sectarian and intra-republican feuding. The Brigade became involved in the July 1997 clashes triggered by the Drumcree conflict. Elaine Mac Farland states that 30,000 Glaswegian Catholics were in the British armed forces in 1916. Eamon Mallie, Patrick Bishop, the Provisional IRA, p141. Firstly, they ousted Billy McKee as OC of the Belfast Brigade, accusing him of demoralising and discrediting the IRA by allowing it to become involved in sectarian and intra-republican feuding. The Brigade became involved in the July 1997 clashes triggered by the Drumcree conflict. [12], It is probable that Patrick was mistakenly included in Robinson’s list. The Scottish Brigade of the Old Irish Republican Army ( Óglaigh na hÉireann ) The Scottish Brigade of the Old IRA. In practice, however, the ceasefire brought little diminution of the violence in Belfast. [9], Several leading Glasgow Fenians appear to have disapproved of plans for a Rising. Several leading Glasgow Fenians appear to have disapproved of plans for a Rising and to have both avoided participation themselves and disrupted attempts to enlist support for it. In late 1997 and early 1998, loyalist paramilitaries carried out a spate of killings of Catholic civilians in response to the killing of Billy Wright by the Irish National Liberation Army. At Easter 1916 sixteen members of the Glasgow unit of the Irish Volunteers fought in Dublin during the insurrection. In 2005, Denis Donaldson, a former Belfast IRA man and senior Sinn Féin worker, was "outed" as an informer. [5], McKee became the first Officer Commanding (OC) of the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade. In 1990, senior Sinn Féin and IRA figure Danny Morrison was arrested in a house in Belfast where an informer was being interrogated. By the end of 1971, it had 1,200 members, giving it a large but loosely-controlled structure.[14]. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, loyalist paramilitaries stepped up their killings of Catholics. - they have left us our Fenian dead, and while Ireland holds these graves, Ireland    unfree shall never be at peace". [17], Up to 1972, the PIRA in Belfast effectively controlled many nationalist areas of the city, manning permanent checkpoints and barricades. All but one were eventually interned in Frongoch prison camp in north Wales before being released with the other internees in various batches during the second half of 1916. [29], Indeed, only one of our sample, Séamus McGalloghly, was arrested for the shooting incident during the attempt to free Frank Carty in Glasgow.[30]. [8], McKee himself contributed greatly to this image by an action he undertook on 27 June 1970. the Norman invasion of Ireland). [15], From 26 June to 10 July 1972 the Provisional IRA leadership declared a ceasefire and held talks with the British government. Many in the IRA argued that the ceasefire period was the closest they had come to defeat so far. [7] Why did only 16 of the 250 active Scottish Volunteers travel to Dublin to fight in the Rising? Lastly, only one of the group aided the pro-Treaty side during the Civil War. Over 300 people were arrested and the area was flooded with CS gas. While many revolutionaries joined different units as they migrated for economic reasons, as can be seen repeatedly in the case of the IRA in Scotland, the partly social nature of Volunteer activism meant that many did not, so McMullan’s actions were not unusual. It was therefore almost with relief that many figures in the IRA Belfast Brigade welcomed the end of the IRA ceasefire in January 1976. This, however, has never been proven. These 'no-go areas', however, were re-taken by the British Army in response to the Bloody Friday bombings of 1972, in a major operation named Operation Motorman. The Belfast Brigade in general welcomed this respite. British Intelligence was also able to use the ceasefire period to recruit more informants within the IRA. The nucleus of the Belfast Brigade emerged in the divisions within Belfast republicans in the closing months of 1969, and was formally established in January 1970 as the structures of the new splinter group were created. In response, loyalists prepared to attack the vulnerable Catholic enclave of Short Strand in east Belfast. Secondly, they overhauled the IRA's structures, greatly reducing the numbers of volunteers who engaged in attacks and organising them into closed cells, or "active service units", so that the information any one IRA man would have about the organisation would be limited to five or six people. Partly as a result of the losses they suffered through arrests in this period, and partly as a result of secret negotiations between the IRA leadership and the British government, the Provisional IRA called a ceasefire from January 1975 to January 1976. The IRA's new cell structure was somewhat compromised during the 1981 hunger strikes. It was therefore almost with relief that many figures in the IRA Belfast Brigade welcomed the end of the IRA ceasefire in January 1976. Joe Robinson did not serve in the Rising, having been arrested for arms smuggling along with Scottish Republican Séamus Reader in January 1916. [2], On 22 September, McKee and a number of other armed, IRA men, arrived at a meeting called by McMillen and tried to oust him as head of the Belfast IRA. The period was also costly for the IRA. By the time of the Truce with the British on 11 July 1921 only 3 of the 14 who remained alive had completely dropped out of the IRA.
