Op 7 september in dat jaar begon Coleman met zijn land aan de kwalificatie voor het wereldkampioenschap voetbal 2014. [15] He later succeeded the Frenchman as caretaker manager in April 2003, and steered Fulham away from relegation danger.  [34], In October 2015, Coleman led Wales to their best ever position on the FIFA World Rankings, 8th. [60], In June 2010, Coleman worked as a commentator for ITV at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. [64] In 2017, he was awarded an honorary degree from his hometown's University of Swansea,[65] and fellowships at three other Welsh universities. [51] The club had become notable during the year for completing the high-profile signing of Javier Mascherano from Spanish La Liga giants Barcelona. Chris Coleman reveals how Brazil can stop Belgium talisman Eden Hazard World Cup 2018 my chris of life. With the club in 5th place and having only lost once in its previous eleven games, Coleman resigned as manager on 16 January 2008, citing a divergence in vision for the club with newly elected President Iñaki Badiola. He began his career at Manchester City, leaving as a teenager to make his debut for hometown team Swansea City in 1987. In de laatste interland onder zijn leiding, een oefenduel tegen Panama (1-1) op 14 november 2017, liet hij nog vier spelers debuteren in het Welsh elftal: Tom Lockyer (Bristol City), Lee Evans (Wigan Athletic), Marley Watkins (Norwich City) en Ryan Hedges (Barnsley). As a player, Coleman usually played in defence, while also occasionally appearing as a forward. [44], During the winter transfer window, Coleman was informed that club chairman Ellis Short had refused to invest any more money into player transfers, with the American businessman announcing his intentions to sell the club. Enjoyed a journeyman playing career with Swansea, Crystal Palace, Blackburn and Fulham before his career was ended by a broken leg suffered in a car crash. [57], He is married to TV presenter Charlotte Jackson. [45], After their transfer window nightmare, Sunderland went on a nine-game winless run, ending when they defeated Derby County 4–1 at Pride Park. [21], Coleman was appointed manager of Championship club Coventry City on 19 February 2008, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. Sunderland boss Chris Coleman fires on £70k-a-week Jack Rodwell, "He trains with the U23’s every morning, in that nice, safe umbrella, not in the spotlight or the firing line with the rest of us", Chris Coleman may be handed an escape route from relegated Sunderland - by Championship side Ipswich, The Black Cats were condemned to relegation on Saturday after defeat to Burton Albion, Sunderland relegated to League One after Burton Albion defeat ensures successive relegations for the Black Cats, The Black Cats fell to a 2-1 defeat against Nigel Clough's side, meaning Chris Coleman's men will be in League One next season, Ryan Giggs admits he's more nervous as Wales boss than any point during trophy-laden Manchester United career, The Old Trafford legend takes charge of his country for the first time on Thursday, Wales' Ryan Giggs urged not to make same mistake Chris Coleman did when he succeeded tragic Gary Speed, The Manchester United legend must do it his way even if it means ditching methods that saw previous regime deliver Euro 2016 glory, says former Dragons stalwart. [4] He then joined his hometown club Swansea City. Fulham, at the time in the Second Division, were financed by wealthy businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed, and were able to spend a record transfer fee for the division and club, of £2.1 million for Coleman in late 1997. However, Coleman's career was effectively ended midway through the season, after he broke his leg in a car crash, near Bletchingley in Surrey on 2 January 2001, just days before an FA Cup tie against Manchester United. He remained captain and a regular in the team under new manager Jean Tigana in the 2000–01 season as Fulham made a successful start to the campaign. Coleman wist Wales niet naar het WK voetbal 2018 te loodsen en besloot daarop op te stappen. Coleman went on to manage the Cottagers for four years before later taking the Wales national job. After making 143 appearances, scoring 16 goals in that period – a 1 in 9 record explained by the fact that manager Steve Coppell often used Coleman as a makeshift centre forward. Coleman tekende in november 2017 een contract tot medio 2020 bij Sunderland AFC, waar hij de ontslagen Simon Grayson opvolgde. [52][53][54] His side finished the 2018 Super League season in sixth position, two places and fourteen points adrift from qualification to the 2019 AFC Champions League. In 2005, Palace supporters voted Coleman into their Centenary XI. Coleman nam in dat duel de enige treffer van Wales voor zijn rekening, nadat hij in de 59ste minuut was ingevallen voor Eric Young. They won promotion as Division One champions at the first attempt, but went straight back down again despite reaching the semi-finals of both cups that season. [3], The first professional team Coleman was contracted to was Manchester City, aged 16, although he later left them, citing homesickness as the major reason. [43] By the conclusion of 2017, Sunderland had collected eleven points, out of a possible twenty-four, under Coleman's guidance, briefly lifting out of the relegation zone into twenty-first place, following a satisfactory run of form. [37], On 23 May 2016, it was announced at a Football Association of Wales press conference that Coleman had signed a two-year contract extension to take in the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign. On 26 May 2011, Coleman was appointed as manager of Greek side AEL. [56] Having only won one game that league season, a 2–1 victory over Shanghai Greenland Shehua, he was sacked on 15 May due to poor performance. After leaving Fulham, Coleman was appointed manager of Real Sociedad, where he resigned in January 2008 due to differences with the incoming president. Hij maakte zijn debuut op woensdag 29 april 1992 in de vriendschappelijke uitwedstrijd tegen Oostenrijk, evenals Jason Rees (Luton Town) en Lee Nogan (Watford). He made nearly 200 appearances for the south Wales club and helped win the Welsh Cup in 1989 and 1991.[6][7]. [16], His first full season in charge saw Fulham finish a surprise ninth place, as many pundits tipped them to struggle and for Coleman to be sacked. Wales werd in de halve finale van het EK uitgeschakeld door Portugal (0–2), na in de eerdere twee knock-outwedstrijden Noord-Ierland (1–0) en België (3–1) te hebben verslagen. Christopher Patrick Coleman, OBE  (born 10 June 1970) is a Welsh professional football coach  and former player, who most recently served as the manager of Chinese Super League  club Hebei China Fortune  from June 2018 until May 2019.
