But besides the things that you see, you always wanna flesh out with history, or you get a non-complete human. Did you know more about him? And for the final season, the, NOW WATCH:  What it's like inside the largest mall in America, What it's like to survive a punishing Michael Bay movie set, according to '13 Hours' star Pablo Schreiber. 	Nick Sobotka Yeah, exactly. And to know that it has an effect that is wide ranging is probably the best compliment that I can get, so thank you.

So, comedy or drama for me, it’s “let’s do it all,” and they all have their own perks and interests. And the moment when Patz confesses and kills himself, and he is faced with the fact that he went all out, to prosecute a child, who (at that moment) appears to not be guilty, I think it really rocks him to his core, and he questions everything that he was doing. Was it an odd experience to pretend to intimidate Captain America?  And it’s not until the very end that you realize that he’s really fighting and has fought since the court case. We don’t get too much backstory on Neal, probably intentionally. Also, Cherry Jones is from my alma mater, Carnegie Mellon University and also a very classic theater actress. 		Birth place I try to shave or buzz my head every few weeks, and when my beard goes crazy, I trim it down. 		 “On my first day, I overslept and I woke up an hour after my call time,” Schreiber recently told Business Insider. As harsh as the reality is in so many ways, there are definitely blessings in disguise, and one of them is spending time with your family when you didn’t think you were gonna get to.             Account active 		First episode Do you prefer serious roles or the broad comedy that you sometimes do? With the finale, though, it became clear that Neal was working toward another objective (in flashback form) all along. Pablo has also terrified viewers at times, including his portrayal of one of the evilest guys in Law and Order: SVU‘s lengthy history. By clicking ‘Sign up’, you agree to receive marketing emails from Business Insider 		Seasons Of course, you always wanna flesh out your backstory, and we see a little bit of that between characters. 	Ymir, British Columbia, Canada That’s okay, I’ve played various characters that you love to hate, and so my job is to fulfill my job within a story, and Neal felt like an opportunity to play someone who was viewed one way but only really because of perspective and point-of-view. 	 He’s going to become a very high paid [private attorney], and his moral compass is probably not going to be trained to true North at all.  For the HBO show’s second season, which aired in 2003 and focused on international smuggling in a Baltimore port, Schreiber landed the role of Nick Sobotka, who has knowledge of the shady business going on at the docks and who, by the end of the season, snitches about the operation.  You’ve done a lot of anti-procedural (The Wire) and procedural (Law and Order: SVU) roles, so how did you settle upon doing Defending Jacob? I’m used to that.

That's evident enough: As Nick Sobotka, Schreiber gets one of the most emotional and powerful moments of the entire series in the season-two ending. He went on to recurring roles in cable dramas Orange Is the New Black and American Gods. And for the final season, the character returns in a cameo as we see him heckling the Baltimore mayor at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. 	“The Dickensian Aspect” He viewed himself as the next in line, and I think was doing everything possible to get himself in that position.  It was great fun to work with him and to create. I’m fluctuating between just letting myself completely go for short periods of time until I have to do some kind of basic upkeep. He can do everything, including confronting Chris Evans on Defending Jacob.   He has a recurring role as Nick Sobotka in The Wire.

Many people remember him as George “Pornstache” Mendez from OITNB. It’s really a great gift for me as a storyteller to push myself as many different places and be with people doing many different things.  I started my career in the theater, and to get to spar with her was really, truly one of the highlights of my career. 	“Ebb Tide” 	 	13 I think especially for this role, to get somebody ready, you’d have to show them the ending to make the beginning work.  When it’s working, it does a really good job of that, and other times, it probably falls short, but I was really drawn to the writing.  Does a role like this go home with you at night? I was working in Hungary for about six months before the pandemic hit, so when we got shut down, I came home, and it feels like a real opportunity to be with the kids and taking care of their education.
