It was the scene where Cher actually complains and makes fun of the music, and I remember being like, “Cher! The original pressing is supposed to be much cleaner so I will buy that. In a listening career of over 50 years and very varied tastes, I have come late to Radiohead after seeing their Glasto performance. Did you see it? The severe distortion applied to the lead vocal track makes understanding the lyrics difficult, a creative choice that removes the emphasis from the words themselves, and places it almost exclusively on the sound the band have created from Thom’s voice. The records are a good weight, and sound great to me. Picked this up for the 20th anniversary, the more rocking tracks sound great but the more atmospheric tracks like "Motion Picture Soundtrack" and "Treefingers" have tons of crackle and pops even after a spin wash.

While some of the lyrics make clear references to literature and politics, it is unlikely that Thom intended for the song itself to carry a clear intellectual meaning. Couldn't recommend it more highly. They made a record they loved, and I think that’s one of the reasons why the song “Optimistic” is one we plucked and put into our live shows some years later.

A break from their more guitar-based earlier work, but a logical progression from the inquisitive side of OK Computer, Kid A is far more concerned with texture and far less concerned with verse/chorus/verse. i own this version and sounds fantastic :D artwork also looks fine, higly recommended!! It was the kind of music you wouldn’t see on a show like Friends. Easily my best sounding Radiohead record (In Rainbows, The Bends, and OK Comp). Radiohead’s creative breakthrough arrived when the band embraced electronica -- which was nearly a cliché by the end of the '90s, when everyone from U2 to Rickie Lee Jones dabbled in trip-hop or techno. ●.
