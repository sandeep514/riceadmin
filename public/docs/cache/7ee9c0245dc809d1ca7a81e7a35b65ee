[151] Johnson had a strained relationship with Duncan Smith, and The Spectator became critical of the latter's party leadership. "[612], Johnson has evoked comparisons (both ideological and physical) with United States President Donald Trump. Before the election, Johnson published Johnson's Life of London, a work of popular history that the historian A. N. Wilson characterised as a "coded plea" for votes. Resourceful, cunning and strategic, he can pull off serious political coups when the greater good happens to coincide with his personal advantage but these aspirations are rarely backed up by concrete achievements, or even detailed plans. [238] He tried placating critics who had deemed him a bigot by appearing at London's gay pride parade and praising ethnic minority newspapers. Max Joseph From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Max Joseph (born January 16, 1982) is an American filmmaker and television host. If we did not have one, we would invent something like it. [453] The Chancellor Sajid Javid also announced that the spending review would be fast-tracked to September. Johnson increased the number of ministers attending the Cabinet to 33, four more than had attended the May Cabinet. [193] In July 2008, Johnson visited the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, there offending his Chinese hosts with his attire. [465] On 20 March 2020, Johnson requested the closure of pubs, restaurants, gyms, entertainment venues, museums and galleries that evening, though with some regret, saying "We’re taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub". [78] His articles appealed to the newspaper's conservative, middle-class, middle-aged "Middle England" readership,[79] and were known for their distinctive literary style, replete with old-fashioned words and phrases and for regularly referring to the readership as "my friends". "[539] Furthermore, Purnell said that Johnson was a "highly evasive figure" when it came to his personal life,[540] who remained detached from others and who had very few if any intimate friends. [281] The IOPC issued its report in May 2020, concluding that, although there was no basis for any criminal charge, there was evidence that decisions by officials had been influenced by the close relationship between Johnson and Arcuri. [102] His writing style was condemned by some critics as bigotry; in various columns he used the words "piccannies" and "watermelon smiles" when referring to Africans, championed European colonialism in Uganda[103][104][105] and referred to gay men as "tank-topped bumboys". [491], Johnson's biographer and friend Andrew Gimson said that while "in economic and social matters, [Johnson] is a genuine liberal", he retains a "Tory element" to his personality through his "love of existing institutions, and a recognition of the inevitability of hierarchy". For seven seasons, Joseph was a host and cameraman for Catfish: The TV Show. [194] As a result of these problems, many in the Conservative Party initially distanced themselves from Johnson's administration, fearing that it would be counter-productive to achieving a Conservative victory in the 2010 general election. [56] To his later regret, he joined the Old Etonian-dominated Bullingdon Club, an exclusive drinking society notorious for acts of vandalism on host premises. [294] In 2016, he said he was "genuinely worried that he could become president", telling ITV's Tom Bradby of one moment where he was mistaken for Trump in New York as "one of the worst moments" of his life. [500] In Politico, Michael Hirsch compared Johnson to Trump, suggesting that both were advocates of a "New Nationalism". [278] The Sunday Times said in September 2019 that Johnson failed to declare his personal relationship as a conflict of interest. [230][231] At the beginning of his tenure as mayor, Johnson announced plans to extend pay-as-you-go Oyster cards to national rail services in London. [479], Following criticism about his chief political advisor, Dominic Cummings, who had made a trip  with his family to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown while suffering from mild covid, both Cummings and Johnson rejected calls for the former to resign. [574], In 2019, Johnson was living with Carrie Symonds, the daughter of Matthew Symonds, son of John Beavan, Baron Ardwick and a co-founder of The Independent newspaper, and Josephine McAfee, a lawyer. <br> <br>[325][326][327] Former Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt said: "I wish it was a joke". [504] Since the Brexit campaign, he has criticised the "cynicism of the elite" about Brexit,[505] described an "elite conspiracy to thwart Brexit",[506] and accused the elite of being "frankly indifferent to the suffering that their policies are causing". [289] The comments were branded "idiotic" and "deeply offensive" by Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames,[305] and were condemned as racist and unacceptable by several Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians. <br> <br>One-man melting pot ready to take on King Newt", "BBC – Who Do You Think You Are? [4][7][8], In September 1960, then-Senator John F. Kennedy first visited Jacobson shortly before the 1960 presidential election debates. His September 2019 prorogation of Parliament was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court. [130] Alongside his Islington home, Johnson bought a farmhouse outside Thame in his new constituency. Under the influence of this milieu and of his wife, Johnson moved in a more liberal direction on issues like climate change, LGBT rights and race relations. [208] He was accused of cronyism,[209] in particular for appointing Veronica Wadley, a former Evening Standard editor who had supported him, as the chair of London's Arts Council when she was widely regarded as not being the best candidate for the position. Dr. Max Jacobson (3 July 1900 – 1 December 1979) was a German physician and medical researcher who treated numerous high profile clients in America, including President John F. Kennedy. [165] He campaigned in 2006 to become the Rector of the University of Edinburgh, but his support for top-up fees damaged his campaign, and he came third. [267] In 2012, Johnson was re-elected as mayor, again defeating Livingstone. [256] In turn he remained largely supportive of his friends in the media – among them Rupert Murdoch – during the News International phone hacking scandal. [62] In 1984, Johnson was elected secretary of the Oxford Union,[63] and campaigned unsuccessfully for the career-enhancing and important position of Union President. "[413] On the campaign trail, Johnson warned of "catastrophic consequences for voter trust in politics" if the government pushed the EU for further delays. [541] Among friends and family, Johnson is known as "Al" (short for his forename Alexander), rather than his middle name "Boris". [489] Stuart Reid, Johnson's colleague at The Spectator, described the latter's views as being those of a "liberal libertarian". [543] Highly ambitious and very competitive, Johnson was, Gimson wrote, born "to wage a ceaseless struggle for supremacy". [418] He received 114 votes in the ballot, the first of five, that took place that day. [224] He introduced a public bicycle scheme that had been mooted by Livingstone's administration; colloquially known as "Boris Bikes", the partly privately financed system cost £140 million and was a significant financial loss but proved popular. [430], On 28 August 2019, Johnson declared he had asked the Queen to prorogue parliament from 10 September, narrowing the window in which parliament could block a no-deal Brexit. [514] In 2019, Johnson said he would take Britain out of the EU on 31 October whether there was a deal in place or not. After Theresa May became leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister, she appointed Johnson Foreign Secretary in July 2016. ", "Conservative moderates plan to take back control of Boris Johnson as prime minister", "Don't lump Boris Johnson together with Donald Trump", "Want to stop Johnson? Overweight and goosey-fleshed, he's the antithesis of an airbrushed pin-up. [458], On 3 September 2019, Phillip Lee crossed the floor to the Liberal Democrats following disagreement with Johnson's Brexit policy.  <br>[71] According to later biographer Sonia Purnell – who was Johnson's Brussels deputy[82] – he helped make Euroscepticism "an attractive and emotionally resonant cause for the Right", whereas previously it had been associated with the British Left. Comparing May's approach to that of the US President Donald Trump – who at the time was engaged in a combative trade war with the EU due to its raising of tariffs on metal – Johnson said: "Imagine Trump doing Brexit. [515][514][516], In 2018, during the Brexit negotiations, he called for Britain to leave the Single Market[514] and advocated a more liberal approach to immigration than that of Prime Minister Theresa May. <br> [487] The Guardian stated that while mayor, Johnson blended economic and social liberalism,[488] with The Economist saying that in doing so Johnson "transcends his Tory identity" and adopts a more libertarian perspective. [370][371] The authority rejected the suggestion that it was quibbling over newspaper headlines and not Johnson's actual words. [188][189], Settling into the City Hall mayoral office,[190] Johnson's first official engagement was an appearance at the Sikh celebrations for Vaisakhi in Trafalgar Square. [495] In 2019, former Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party Michael Heseltine said Johnson "has no right to call himself a one-nation Conservative" and wrote: "I fear that any traces of liberal conservatism that still exist within the prime minister have long since been captured by the rightwing, foreigner-bashing, inward-looking view of the world that has come to characterise his fellow Brexiters". "[292] He later called Trump's comments "ill informed" and "complete and utter nonsense", adding that "the only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump". [126], – Max Hastings, London Evening Standard, [127], Following Michael Heseltine's retirement, Johnson decided to stand as Conservative candidate for Henley, a Conservative safe seat in Oxfordshire. [302], In February 2016, Johnson endorsed Vote Leave in the "Out" campaign for the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. [70], In September 1987, Johnson and Mostyn-Owen were married in West Felton, Shropshire, accompanied by a duet for violin and viola Allegra e Boris[72] specially commissioned for the wedding from Hans Werner Henze. Spending six weeks campaigning, he attained 9,091 votes (23%) in the 1997 general election, losing to the Labour candidate. explored the German origins of his middle name Pfeffel. <br> <br>[555], In 2007, Johnson said he had smoked cannabis before he went to university. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:21:"max johnson wikipedia";s:5:"links";s:6522:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/raising-cain-ending-86e6ec'>Raising Cain Ending</a>,
