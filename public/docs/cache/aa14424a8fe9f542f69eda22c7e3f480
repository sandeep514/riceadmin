In the paper, Clarke set out the first principles of global communication via satellites placed in geostationary orbits. His work ranged from scientific discovery to science fiction, from technical application to entertainment. They may be summed up by the phrases: (1) It’s completely impossible. After the launch of the Sputnik satellite by the Soviet Union in 1957, the discussion of the use of outer space by different nations of the Earth become an important global issue. They distort our thinking, making us believe that what is true now will be true forever, though perhaps on a larger scale. They can travel at a hundred miles an hour, but are lucky if they average forty. You have done more than anyone to give us a vision of mankind reaching out from cradle Earth to our future in the stars. As important as Arthur Clarke’s achievements in engineering were to the modern world, he is at least as well known as a futurist, trying to predict what the world of tomorrow might look like, and as a popularizer of science, helping make science accessible to everyone. …we cannot predict the new forces, powers, and discoveries that will be disclosed to us when we reach the other planets or can set up new laboratories in space. Clarke also wrote a novelization of the film; the resulting book, which is based on the early drafts of the film and differs from it in some ways, also came out in 1968. But the questions are certainly worth thinking about. Clarke was devoted to making sure the next generation would receive the best education possible. The vendors seemed comical, so intent were they on their slivers of meaningless profit, all unaware of the desolate ages that lay in their own near future, their own imminent deaths. It has yet to be proven that intelligence has any survival value. I’ve had a diverse career as a writer, underwater explorer, space promoter and science populariser. Our age is in many ways unique, full of events and phenomena that never occurred before and can never happen again. (3) I said it was a good idea all along. Clarke’s most famous non-fiction work as a futurist may be the book Profiles of the Future, based on a series of essays he started writing in 1958 and published in book form in 1962. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong. Because even though itâs a bummer, living without utilities is kind of uncomfortable. —Gene Roddenberry, American television screenwriter, producer and futurist, Arthur somehow manages to capture the hopeless but admirable human desire to know things that can really never be known. It’s the zero adjust on his bathroom scale. By Martin Anderson. Two possibilities exist: Either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Clarke saw his vision of global telecommunications via satellites start to become reality in 1964 with the launch of the first geostationary communication satellite Syncom 3, which was used to broadcast the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo to the United States. We always thought the living Earth was a thing of beauty. I’ve been living in Sri Lanka for 50 years — and half that time, I’ve been a sad witness to the bitter conflict that divides my adopted country. In the struggle for freedom of information, technology, not politics, will be the ultimate decider. The combination is unstable and self-destroying. Arthur C. Clarke formulated the following three "laws" of prediction: 1. To obtain a mental picture of the distance to the nearest star, as compared with the distance to the nearest planet, you must imagine a world in which the closest object to you is only five feet away — and there is nothing else to see until you have traveled a thousand miles. Yet Clarke was always optimistic about the future of humanity; he firmly believed that technological achievements would solve our current problems and lead to a better and brighter future for the entire human race. Arthur Clarke was always interested in the future of human race, not only in terms of what that future might look like, technologically speaking, but also in terms of what kind of a world we, the current inhabitants of our home planet, would leave to the future generations. He is a seer of modern science. Why was he wrong? I’ve had a diverse career as a writer, underwater explorer, space promoter and science populariser. He worked with astronautic material in the Society, contributed to the BIS Bulletin, and began writing science fiction. A geostationary satellite orbits the Earth above the equator so that the period of the orbit (the time it takes the satellite to complete one orbit around the Earth) is the same as the Earth’s rotational period (the time it takes the Earth to rotate once around its axis.) We have abolished space here on the little Earth; we can never abolish the space that yawns between the stars. Though Clarke was technically right about the possibility of self-sufficient homes, he failed to understand that it wouldnât be convenient. Sir Arthur Charles Clarke (16 December 1917 - 19 March 2008) was a British science fiction author, inventor, and futurist, most famous for  —Foreword to the Millennial Edition of 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1999, … we have a situation in which millions of vehicles, each a miracle of (often unnecessary) complication, are hurtling in all directions under the impulse of anything up to two hundred horsepower. In 1966, Arthur C. Clarke put forth a series of predictions about the year 2001. The Information Age offers much to mankind, and I would like to think that we will rise to the challenges it presents. We seldom stop to think that we are still creatures of the sea, able to leave it only because, from birth to In 1966, Arthur C. Clarke put forth a series of predictions about the year 2001. Today’s world relies so heavily on global satellite telecommunications networks that it would be difficult to imagine what the world would look like without them. Politicians should read science fiction, not westerns and detective stories. Clarke worked for decades in television, bringing scientific and engineering achievements to people’s homes across the world. Our technology must still be laughably primitive; we may well be like jungle savages listening for the throbbing of tom-toms, while the ether around them carries more words per second than they could utter in a lifetime. —Foreword to 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968, One of the biggest roles of science fiction is to prepare people to accept the future without pain and to encourage a flexibility of mind. —Electronic Tutors, 1980, The dinosaurs disappeared because they could not adapt to their changing environment. —Buzz Aldrin, American mechanical engineer, retired United States Air Force pilot and astronaut who was the lunar module pilot on Apollo 11 and the second human being to set foot on the moon, You are deservedly the best known science fiction writer in the world. Clarke’s only non-science-fiction novel, Glide Path, was based on his experiences in this project. Clarke was involved in these discussions by, e.g., addressing the United Nations during their deliberations on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. His body of work contains more than 70 books of fiction and non-fiction, and he received numerous awards for his writing. Both are equally terrifying. âGiven a compact power sourceâ¦the house of the future would have no roots tying it to the ground. He was an officer in charge of the first radar talk-down equipment, the Ground Controlled Approach, during its experimental trials. —Meeting of the Minds : Buzz Aldrin Visits Arthur C. Clarke, Andrew Chaikin, 2001, SETI is probably the most important quest of our time, and it amazes me that governments and corporations are not supporting it sufficiently. In true future futurist fashion, he got a little bit right and a lot wrong. Yet now, as he roared across the night sky toward an unknown destiny, he found himself facing that bleak and ultimate question which so few men can answer to their satisfaction. He often incorporated his visions of the technological advances in the near future into his science fiction writing. 3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Future predictions are about the promise of progress, not about accuracy. Click here to upload more images (optional). —Seti@Home, 2006, 2001 was written in an age which now lies beyond one of the great divides in human history; we are sundered from it forever by the moment when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped out on to the Sea of Tranquility. The idea of these kinds of orbits was originally proposed in 1928, but Clarke was the first to suggest that geostationary orbits would be ideal for establishing worldwide telecommunication relays. As a child, he enjoyed stargazing and reading American science fiction magazines, which sparked his lifelong enthusiasm for space sciences. Dead wrong. These so-called laws are: When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. Do you agree or disagree with the content of this page? The greatest tragedy in mankind’s entire history may be the hijacking of morality by religion. Though the Earth will try to keep in touch with her children, in the end all the efforts of her archivists and historians will be defeated by time and distance, and the sheer bulk of material.
