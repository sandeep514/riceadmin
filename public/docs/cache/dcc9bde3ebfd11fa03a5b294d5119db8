</html>";s:4:"text";s:10301:"<p>Something is not right. In between small-time grifts and messy bar fights and thankless errands for heavy-breathing mafia types—in between celebrations for returning Vietnam vets whose personalities are most likely blasted by PTSD, childhood neighborhood friends unequipped to understand anything about that experience on the other side of the world—Charlie spends all effort hiding the life he wants from the life he’s earning, from the life of his culture, his people, his neighborhood. A few moments before, while in a car with her mother, she lays her head on the window wistfully and says with a sigh, “I wish I could just live through something.” Stuck in Sacramento, where she thinks there’s nothing to be offered her while paying acute attention to everything her home does have to offer, Lady Bird—and the film, written and directed by Greta Gerwig, that shares her name—has ambivalence running through her veins. No art exists in a vacuum, but The Other Side of the Wind, more than most, bleeds its own context. She’s the blueprint for every mid-twenties late bloomer. New York, The film within the film is a riff on art film, with perhaps the strongest winks at Michelangelo Antonioni and Zabriskie Point. </p> <p>This is, at first, a horror story about teenagers uniting under the banner of heavy metal in 1980s America, a time when God-fearing Christian bedwetters saw proof of devil worship everywhere they gawked and blamed the rise of Satanism on objectively awesome things like Dungeons & Dragons and Dio. © </p> <p>With the downhome nihilism of No Country for Old Men and Fargo, the mythological whimsy of O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the back-breaking metaphysical weight of A Serious Man or the cutting capers of Raising Arizona, the whole of The Ballad of Buster Scruggs—shot as a series of awe-inspiring vistas by DP Bruno Delbonnel punctuated by the porous mugs of the pioneers who populate them—sings to an unparalleled canon of genres and tones. Levity is found in and around the squared circle, thanks to comedy veteran Ken Marino and a star-making performances by pro wrestler Keith Lee. We howl with laughter, though we can’t help feeling bad for every poor bastard caught on the receiving end of trademark Iannucci verbal abuse, which typically means we end up feeling bad for every character in his films. They light up the screen in this documentary; they are the true stars, and they bring the real magic to this story. —Dom Sinacola, Year: 2017 Director: Yorgos Lanthimos Stars: Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Barry Keoghan, Raffey Cassidy, Sunny Suljic, Alicia Silverstone, Bill Camp Rating: R Runtime: 121 minutes, In the uncanny valley of a Yorgos Lanthimos film, characters resemble human beings…but not entirely. It all works. When his mentally challenged brother gets caught, a man (Robert Pattinson) goes to desperate measures to break him out. Did they focus on their art at the expense of parenthood? </p> <p>They have multiple intentions, and they bring those intentions together to jam. John Huston plays John Huston as Jake Hannaford who is also Orson Welles, trying to finish The Other Side of the Wind much like Welles tried to finish The Other Side of the Wind, over the course of years with no real budget and by the seats-of-everyone’s-pants. The self-awareness of the film could have been unbearable, except awareness (and our fragmentary experience of it) is so entirely the point of everything that the film is wrapped up within and that is wrapped up within it. It should be bad, but it’s not; it should be, at best, cheesy fun—but it’s even more than that. Come for the violence, The Night Comes for Us bids you—and, also, stay for the violence. It left me exhausted, but I kinda want to see it again. The bad news: Netflix isn't hosting as many films as it used to. We've just updated this list with The Trial of the Chicago 7, the new Netflix original movie from Aaron Sorkin. Watch now. It’s a clash of old and new, of royal privilege and celebrity privilege, and standing at the juncture is Diana, beholder of charisma, a royal and then a royal no more, a celebrity but one made through her connection to people who were born with power. But in recent years, they’ve struggled to conceive, a process that no amount of fertility treatments has been able to remedy. </p> <p>New entries include Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Millie Bobbie Brown in Enola Holmes, Will Ferrell in Stranger than Fiction and Sam Neill in Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Atlantics is about that and it’s about the breaking of that. She disappears behind the door. There are dueling gossip columnist twins (Tilda Swinton pulling double duty), a hapless film editor (Frances McDormand) and scattered movies-within-the-movie, which even pauses midway through for a thoroughly enchanting—and cheeky—Gene Kelly-styled song-and-dance number starring Channing Tatum as a heavily made-up matinee star with controversial extracurricular activities. It’s also their most Jewish film to date, a film about physics professor Larry Gopnik and the Jewish subculture of a medium-sized late-’60s American town. </p> <p>Be warned: This story is just basically bad things happening to people, non-stop. It’s also a portrait of childhood cast in the shadow of dispassionate brutality, and what a young girl must do to find safety in a world defined by bloodshed. Every odd little tic, every awkward laugh, each inexplicable grimace—the gestures all shine through as genuine to anyone who has seen The Room, or even an interview with Wiseau. After Erica walks out on him, an inebriated Mark goes back to his Harvard dorm room and disses Erica with aspersions to her character and bra size on the school’s social page for everyone to see while also creating a new social website which, with help from a few friends, eventually becomes Facebook. When Shoya Ishida meets Shoko Nishimiya, a deaf transfer student, in elementary school, he bullies her relentlessly to the amusement of his classmates. Sure, but how many great martial arts films are completely dour? And maybe the one true through line of history is that stupid people will always follow stupid people, whistling all the way to our meaningless, futile deaths. Like Oliver Stone’s 1987 film Wall Street, greed is still king and the wolves are at the door. </p> <p>Furiously. </p> <p>It ends with a scene between a boy and a girl, something that normally would come right out of a dopey rom-com, but in a way that subverts the trope on every level, from the inversion of its meaning to the quiet, intimate naturalism with which it is filmed. This beautiful animated movie, which is from the same folks that made the classic Batman: The Animated Series TV series, sees Batman sleuthing about another vigilante, whose actions are seemingly tied to his own tragic past, while Bruce Wayne is falling in love. To do so, he’s explored some well-trodden ground in the form of the rural “cult infiltration movie,” making comparisons to the likes of The Wicker Man (or even Ti West’s The Sacrament) inevitable. Lu Over the Wall blends joy with political allegory with vibrant color palettes with storytelling magic, plus some actual magic, plus too many upbeat musical interludes to count. The screenplay reduces Elizabeth to human scale, but Mirren, with a layered, realistic performance, brings her back from the brink of parody. Director Nahnatchka Khan keeps the stylish film moving at a pleasant comedic clip throughout, and there’s a killer cameo appearance you will not want spoiled before you see the movie. Lane steals the movie, this newbie projecting an almost feral vibrancy which makes her character’s next move consistently unpredictable, looking for something indescribable on this odyssey. A loose chronicle of the nascent legend of Yip Man, the film skirts the line between noir-ish tragedy and chiaroscuro thriller, rarely leaving room to discern the difference. But you don’t need to know all that to appreciate the passion he brought to this project. —Tim Grierson, Year: 1966 Director: Sergio Leone Stars: Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Eli Wallach Genre: Western, Action & Adventure Rotten Tomatoes Score: 97% Rating: R Runtime: 161 minutes, Arguably the greatest of the Italian Westerns, but also one of the finest Westerns ever made. And Lee is still angry at and discontent with the status quo, being the continued oppression of Black Americans through police brutality, voter suppression and medical neglect. There are so many jokes in this movie, and it’s surprising how easily we forget that, considering its reputation. Nadia Hallgren’s film is an attempt at a portrait of a lady seemingly on fire, now that she’s “free at last.” In an early scene, Obama and billionaire Oprah Winfrey laugh as they candidly discuss the relief that came with the end of her time in the White House. Maybe on home video people will have a chance to catch up with this emotional drama, whose intimate contours and precise character work make it just as transporting on the small screen.—Tim Grierson, Year: 2020 Director: Gina Prince-Bythewood Stars: Charlize Theron, Kiki Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Chiwitel Ejiofor, Van Veronico Ngo, Henry Melling, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli Genre: Action, Fantasy Rotten Tomatoes Score: 81% Rating: NR Runtime: 93 minutes, Gina Prince-Bythewood, given a budget more than worthy of the best DTV action flick anyone could hope could make it to permanent Netflix browsal, succeeds in towing, and then mildly subverting, the genre line: She proves she can capably steer a high-concept action blockbuster while cobbling together something that feels like the kind of movie “they” just don’t make anymore. Compared to the year’s other films centered on dysfunctional families, whether hammy (I, Tonya) or naturalist (Lady Bird), My Happy Family is a gentle tribute to dignity: Manana (Ia Shugliashvili) is never less than noble in her constant dedication to her family, even as she determines that to preserve her sanity she must move out of the apartment she shares with them and lay down roots in a pad of her own. This chapter, though, thrives by breaking the rules. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:24:"beste films netflix 2020";s:5:"links";s:5828:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/mount-zion-meaning-86e6ec'>Mount Zion Meaning</a>,
