Tarkovsky himself recounts in. [17], The completed film was initially rejected by Filipp Ermash, the head of Goskino in July 1974. Memories such as the evacuation from Moscow to the countryside during the war, a withdrawn father and his own mother, who actually worked as a proof-reader at a printing press, featured prominently. Max understands that his near-death experience from the car accident has given him the ability to see the spirits. At her request, Ignat reads a passage from a letter by Pushkin and receives a telephone call from his father Alexei. The title was taken from a 1942 poem by his father, Arseny Tarkovsky. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, Göttingen 2007, S. 85–110. Max goes to the main mirror to find out who the ghost is. A flashback shows what happened to Eleanor. In a 2012 Sight & Sound directors' poll, Mirror ranked as the 9th greatest film of all time. Directed by Alexandre Aja. After the opening titles roll, a scene is set in the countryside during prewar times in which Alexei's mother Maria (Margarita Terekhova) — also called Masha and Marusya — talks with a doctor (Anatoly Solonitsyn) who chances to be passing by. Mirror was ultimately approved by Goskino without any changes in fall 1974.[18]. Tarkovsky wanted to use a hidden camera to interview her on the pretext that it was research for the film. Released by 20th Century Fox  in direct-to-video  format, the film is written by Matt Venne and is directed by Víctor García. He reads it before contacting Eleanor's older sister, Elizabeth, to learn details of her disappearance. When Mosfilm critics were asked in November 1974 to evaluate Mirror, responses were divided. Moreover, Tarkovsky and Misharin clearly stated that they did not know what the final form of the film would be – this was to be determined in the process of filming. Is there something during / at the end of the credits ? Max denies any involvement and they let him get back to work, though they remain suspicious. Meanwhile, Jenna is thrown through glass doors by her reflection, and a shard of glass decapitates her. Mirror depicts the thoughts, emotions and memories of Alexei, or Alyosha (Ignat Daniltsev), and the world around him as a child, adolescent, and forty-year-old. As a result, he becomes emotionally disturbed and has to undergo psychological treatment with Dr. Beaumont, making some progress in overcoming the guilt over the accident (although the other driver was responsible for it). In New York, the former NYPD detective Ben Carson is hired to work as night watch of the remains of the Mayflower Department Store that was partially destroyed by fire many years ago. When he goes to the rounds in his first night, he finds that the mirrors are impeccably clean and his colleague explains that the former night watch was obsessed with the mirrors. The adult Alexei is only briefly glimpsed, but is present as a voice-over in some scenes including substantial dialogue. It was written by Marc Klein and Jason Keller, with music by Alan Menken. Keller raped Eleanor while she was intoxicated and finally killed her when she tried to run away. After a couple of nights, Ben sees weird images in the mirrors, but due to the lack of credibility of his past, his ex-wife Amy believes he has hallucinations as a side effect of his medication. Max realizes that he foresees the deaths in the mirrors. Mirror depicts the thoughts, emotions and memories of Alexei, or Alyosha (Ignat Daniltsev), and the world around him as a child, adolescent, and forty-year-old. Directed by Etienne Desrosiers. Mirrors 2 is a 2010 American supernatural horror film. It stars Lily Collins, Julia Roberts, Armie Hammer, Nathan Lane, Mare Winningham, Michael Lerner, and Sean Bean. [21] In a 1975 article for The New York Times, James F.

From "Veronica Mars" to Rebecca take a look back at the career of Armie Hammer on and off the screen. Ben became alcoholic and was retired from the police force after killing a man in a shooting. 19. In the next scene, set in Alexei's apartment, Ignat meets with a strange woman (Tamara Ogorodnikova) sitting at a table. The answer to that question depends upon how effectively the movie brings its genre across to the audience...the interesting plots, the action sequences, the drama. Suddenly, Max's reflection uses his flashlight to show him the way. Keep track of everything you watch; tell your friends. College student Max Matheson survives a car accident that kills his fiancée, Kayla. A young widower returns to his hometown to search for answers to his wife's murder, which may be linked to the ghost of a deceased ventriloquist. The young Alexei, his mother and sister watch as the family barn burns down. [16] The naturalist style of the film required Margarita Terekhova to forego makeup completely. One reason given was that the film is incomprehensible.

Looking for some great streaming picks? Nightmares involving mirrors and faces she's seen during her visit begin to plague her, but her suspicions of something sinister are roused when another guest from the hotel ends up mysteriously killed. The film opens with Alexei's adolescent son Ignat (also played by Ignat Daniltsev) switching on a television and watching the examination of a stammerer by a physician who finally manages to make her patient say without disruptions: "I can talk".

After a young couple take in their two nieces, they suspect that a supernatural spirit named Mama has latched onto their family. However he has not been drinking for three months and sees the employment as a chance to rebuild his life. [19] Some viewed it as a major work that would be better understood upon the analysis of future generations; others dismissed it as an unfocused failure and believed that even more cultured viewers would find its story opaque. Max and Elizabeth go to the Mayflower and search for Eleanor's body in the basement. [9] (The final film does indeed feature several mirrors with some scenes shot in reflection.). [9], With the script being turned down by the film committee, Tarkovsky went on to make the film Solaris.
