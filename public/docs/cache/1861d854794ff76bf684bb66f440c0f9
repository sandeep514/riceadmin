It would have been better, I feel, to take the more severe route of Belgium’s Dardenne brothers – whose films, such as The Son (2002), often have a crucial mystery-suspense element – and simply plunge in, from the first frame, with Lizzie’s stalking of little Lola, thus letting the audience gradually pick up on the clues that explain past events leading up to this. International stars Noomi Rapace and Yvonne Strahovski are the greatest assets in this Australian intimacy thriller, writes Adrian Martin.                      Director Kim Farrant does an excellent job of introducing the main characters and working in each of those involved before leading into the meat of the story. And it takes quite a while – too long, in my opinion – to reach the point of Lizzie’s fully-formed obsession with Lola. Your Ticket Confirmation # is located under the header in your email that reads "Your Ticket Reservation Details". What to Watch if You Miss the "Game of Thrones" Cast. The Australian performer projects an entirely different energy to Rapace: grounded, pragmatic, no-nonsense. Farrant relies a bit too much on her clichéd throbbing cello score to ratchet up the tension. Ignore that because the pay off is worth it. Rapace delivers an almost persistent Lizzie showing that she cannot come to grips with her life since the tragedy.                      Running Time: 1 hr.                      Hit the contribute button now to share your story. Angel of Mine is weighed down by a clunky exposition section, trying to sketch in a lot of backstory concerning the difficult relationship between Lizzie and her former husband, Mike (Luke Evans).

In particular, it eschews the conventional ‘it’s all starting again!’ zinger – which could have easily been wheeled in as a device – that so many thriller and horror films tiresomely deploy.                         | Rating: 3/5 Acting and direction is at a good standard but I found two thirds of the movie boring and so did my wife but I'm glad we stuck it out until the end as the last third of the movie was very good. Video: 1080p Widescreen 16×9, Aspect Ratio 2.35:1 Angel of Mine is one of the best acted, directed and produced movies this year. 2019 has not put out any films to write home about, but if I was to write about one, Angel of mine would definitely be one of them.

Based on the real-life prison break of two political captives, Escape From Pretoria is a race-against-time thriller set in the tumultuous apartheid days of South Africa. Choose an adventure below and discover your next favorite movie or TV show. Video Release Date: October 22, 2019 The Australian adaptation is not quite a success, nor fully a failure. This was a very good watch. Writer, critic, film editor John Delia, Sr. has been on all sides of the movie business from publications to film making. It is well acted and the story is well constructed. This is a slow burner that delivers. At her son's friend's birthday party Lizzie sees a girl named Lola and somehow recognises in her the baby she lost many years ago. Original Theatrical Release Date: August 30, 2019 Overall, it couldn't keep up pace with the beginning that it had. But if you remove the stars and replace them with equally talented unknown actors, what you have left is an above-average Lifetime movie.                      The movie has a solid cast including several promising child actors. John is a member of the Southeastern Film Critics Association. See all Audience reviews Angel of Mine Quotes. Number of Discs: 1 disc Farrant's confidence as a storyteller -- along with Rapace's full-bodied performance -- enrich the story and guide it toward its delicately bonkers premise.                                Audio: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Not just Noomi Rapace but Yvonne Strahovski too. She makes Angel of Mine very captivating by showing Lizzie’s plight to try and move on from her awful loss. With a multi-layered script of surprising twists and turns, as well as amazing performances from Noomi Rapace and Yvonne Strahovski, Angel of Mine is a surprise hit. Happily – in terms of the balance of the drama – Rapace finds her match in Strahovski (best known as Serena Joy in The Handmaid's Tale). Of course, she feels the need to apologize, but for what? I mean stunning, award winning level.                         | Rating: 3/4 We both scored this movie a 6 and agreed that it was worth viewing. Get our latest news straight into your inbox. Noomi Rapace plays a grieving mother whose daughter was killed at the hospital she was born in, now believes that after seeing a little girl at a party she takes her son to, is in fact her deceased daughter and from there begins the unfolding of this suspense story of psychological chaos with a superb twist in the end. The performances by Noomi Rapace and Yvonne Strahovski are equally stunning. Apparently this has irritated me enough that I now feel a bit snarky so I'll go ahead and use it to complain about something else which I wouldn't usually consider bringing up in a review as it has little to do with plot or character. Opinion: Why aren’t there more female cinematographers? Slow moving film which almost made me give up. The story exaggerates at every level yet the filmmakers expect viewers to find it believable. Adrian Martin is a freelance film critic. Angel of Mine is one of the best acted, directed and produced movies this year. I went from grief to suspense to weeping like an old lady.     |                         Was this a deliberate choice or is the costume designer simply colorblind? We just finished Angel of Mine and we are exhausted. Noomi Rapace stars in “Angel of Mine” as Lizzie, an ex-wife and distant mother who seems to be fading away. Swedish actress Noomi Rapace does "unhinged" with a level of commitment that's hard to match.                         |, September 12, 2019                      I really enjoyed it.

A female bodyguard is hired to protect an heiress on the run from assassins. Since then, she’s become estranged from her husband, Mike (Luke Evans). However, the main character seems to be a psychologically disturbed person only and no where creepy or sinister enough to create 'suspense'.

Indulging a child's emotional tantrums do not ever help them in life, not as children and not as adults. I guess an actor can only do so much with the material that they are given.
