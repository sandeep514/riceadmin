Starter(s): Josh AuneBackup(s): Donald Willis. Today, we take a look at the Terrapins’ week two opponent, the Minnesota Golden Gophers… Only a little over a week left, which means it’s time to break down the schedule. P.J. University of Minnesota head softball coach Piper Ritter has announced that Megan Dray (Lynchburg, Va.) will join the Golden Gopher program. Maryland is the other crossover game which is a win for Minnesota. The official 2020 Football Roster for the University of Minnesota Gophers Copyright © 2020 by The Football Database, LLC. Terell Smith is the team’s clear cut No. Mac Jones throws an interception on the first play of the game, then comes back to throw four touchdowns in Alabama's 41-24 win over Georgia. There’s nothing to indicate that he’ll do anything but continue to play at a high level. Until proven otherwise Wisconsin remains the team to beat in the West. There’s no way I can put down anyone besides Rashod Bateman. Junior Mariano Sori-Marin will step into his role after playing in all 13 games last season, including seven starts when Kamal Martin was sidelined. Copyright: © 2020 ESPN Enterprises, Inc. All rights reserved. Coney Durr and Benjamin St-Juste will be one of the best cornerback tandems in the Big Ten, but it is the depth (or lack thereof) behind them that concerns me. They stayed ready until it was time. View the Minnesota Golden Gophers roster for the 2016 FBS college football season. Generally I think expectations for the Gophers are high, but not quite as high as you might think given last season. Starter(s): Keonte SchadBackup(s): DeAngelo Carter. Georgia loses but remains a popular pick, while Alabama and Clemson solidify spots in the top two moving forward. The folks over at CQ tell us what they think we should know about the Hoosiers. Mac Jones recovers from first-pass INT, throws 4 TDs in win over Georgia. Antoine Winfield Jr. leaves a big hole in the secondary, but the return of two-year starter Jordan Howden helps mitigate that to a degree. The folks over at OTB tell us what they think we should know about the Scarlet Knights. Follow. The Gophers miss Penn State and Ohio State during the 8 currently scheduled games. Starter(s): Micah Dew-TreadwayBackup(s): Jamaal Teague. An even bigger concern for depth is the offensive line. Starter(s): Mariano Sori-MarinBackup(s): James Gordon. Whether they can do that is a completely open question, both because of COVID and because of the key players they lost. Along with the release of the new 10-game conference schedule, Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren also announced that programs have been cleared to start fall camp this week. Copyright: © 2020 ESPN Enterprises, Inc. All rights reserved. As noted above, offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca has moved on to Penn State but otherwise the coaching staff remains intact. That remains the Gophers’ hardest test and it’s on the road. Rule 1: You’re allowed to bet against your favorite team. With the Gopher Football season now in the single-digit days until they kickoff against Michigan, I suppose it's about that time to give my annual Minnesota 2020 win prediction. Arlington, TX (Martin HS / Oregon / Houston Baptist), Roswell, GA (Centennial HS / Southwest Mississippi CC (MS)), Lindstrom, MN (Totino-Grace HS / Central Lakes JC (MN)), Marietta, GA (Kell HS / Coffeyville CC (KS)), East St. Louis, IL (Althoff Catholic HS / Iowa Western CC (IA)), Sioux Center, IA (Sioux Center Community HS), Chipley, FL (Chipley HS / Butler County CC (KS)), Bloomingdale, GA (Savannah Christian Prep HS), Springfield, IL (Sacred Heart-Griffin HS), Okoboji, IA (Spirit Lake HS / Iowa Western CC (IA)), Iowa City, IA (West HS / Iowa State / Iowa Western CC (IA)), Fort Walton Beach, FL (Fort Walton Beach HS), Prior Lake, MN (Prior Lake HS / Rochester Community / Technical College (MN)), Beattie, KS (Marysville HS / Butler County CC (KS)). Redshirt freshman Donald Willis, who saw action on special teams last season, will be his chief competition. Plus, explore all of your favorite teams' player rosters on FOXSports.com today! Redshirt freshman James Gordon contributed on special teams last season and is expected to push Sori-Marin for snaps. Howden will need to take Tyler Nubin under his wing, as the sophomore defensive back is the favorite to step into the other starting safety spot. It could be Anderson or maybe one of the true freshmen, like Gage Keys or Jah Joyner. Each blog filled out a questionnaire to give insight, and Testudo Times will go through each game on Maryland football’s schedule. Our friends at The Daily Gopher breakdown what to expect from Minnesota ahead of the 2020 season. Georgia loses but remains a popular pick, while Alabama and Clemson solidify spots in the top two moving forward. Behind Enemy Lines: Preseason preview of the Minnesota Golden Gophers, Maryland football’s offensive line looks to build key consistency in 2020. The best win will be over Wisconsin, because I will always predict a win over Wisconsin on principle. Kamal Martin graduated, and Braelen Oliver appeared to be the heir apparent to the starting will linebacker spot until he suffered a lower body injury in spring practice that could sideline him for most, if not all, of a fall season. To be honest, redshirt freshman M.J. Anderson as Otomewo’s back-up is a complete guess on my part. Find the COLLEGE-FOOTBALL Minnesota Golden Gophers player roster for this season on FOX Sports. Wide receivers look to lean on chemistry and trust in 2020 for Maryland football. I will certainly miss Carter Coughlin for what he brought to the program, but I like Boye Mafe a lot. Minnesota will need to replace seven starters on defense, so we take a look at what the initial depth chart might look like as the Gophers open camp. The secondary has a strong pair of corners in Durr and St. Juste, but safety will remain a question mark until someone proves they can adequately replace Winfield. With Big Ten football set to return to play on the weekend of Oct. 24, each conference member’s SB Nation site came together to preview their own program heading into the 2020 season. Playing with an intensity that has been missing in recent years, unranked Florida State upset No. Fleck is as high energy as ever and seems to have done a good job of handling COVID and the tumult it’s caused for the Big Ten (unlike two high profile peers I could name). For the first time since 2016, the Gopher defense will take the field without Thomas Barber starting at mike linebacker. The running backs should be fine and the offensive line has experience (just not depth). Nubin has the talent to be a playmaker in the defensive backfield, but there will certainly be a maturation process. 24-ranked Minnesota Golden Gophers’ primetime matchup against the No. Lock up USC. Keonte Schad will have big shoes to fill at the three-technique spot, but he showed flashes last year of what he can do in limited action. 6-2 or 7-1 feels right, with outside chances that the Gophers go either 5-3 or 8-0. The senior defensive back hasn’t seen a lot of meaningful snaps in his three years with the program, and has struggled in coverage at times when he has seen the field. Jamaal Teague is also an experienced back-up, as he played in all 13 games last season and recorded 16 tackles, including 1.5 for loss. Sam Renner was a disruptive force up the middle last season, leading the team in sacks and ranking second in tackles for loss. 5 UNC. 5 North Carolina 31-28 on Saturday night, holding on for a victory that was desperately needed as coach Mike Norvell looks to rebuild the program. Cincinnati, Coastal Carolina, Oklahoma State and Texas A&M get nods this week, and BYU and Notre Dame remain in the picture.

Last year in … There is a lot of uncertainty and inexperience at this position. The folks over at CN tell us what they think we should know about the Huskers. 19-ranked Michigan Wolverines in … For that matter, get Michigan outta there. So is Carter Coughlin, who proved to be extremely disruptive as a pass rusher last season despite drawing double teams and holds all season long. The schedule is favorable enough. The kid is too talented and too much of the offense will rely on him. Michigan is the team’s opener, but they are at home. It’s a critical role on defense that requires a player versatile enough to rush the passer, stop the run, or drop into coverage, depending on the call. The starting five has no major concerns, but an injury or regression from any of them leaves a lot of questions. GoAUpher is joined by gopherguy05, Blake Ruane, and UStreet to talk everything future opponent related. He’ll continue to annoy opposing fan bases (which is pure entertainment to Gopher fans) and after 2019 he’s not as easy to dismiss on style alone. The team will be breaking in a new offensive coordinator, the best wide receiver in program history (Tyler Johnson) graduated and First Team All-American safety Antoine Winfield Jr is making a massive impact for Tampa Bay as an NFL rookie. The depth at safety is also suspect, with junior Benny Sapp III and redshirt senior walk-on Calvin Swenson likely to start fall camp as your second-string safeties. Today, we take a look at the Terrapins’ week two opponent, the Minnesota Golden Gophers, with the help of The Daily Gopher’s managing editor, GoAUpher.
