All the films from my exploitation lists, bundled into one mega-super-list-to-rule-them-all! But that said, I did like the way the clowns never came off as silly despite being the flamboyantly colourful rainbow-haired variety. 	 Just before Halloween, three young brothers alone in a big house are menaced by three escaped mental patients who have murdered some traveling circus clowns and taken their identities. It was a very good movie and I recommend it for anyone to watch.................. Off the record if anyone knows what I am talking about please let me know. The only good thing about this movie is Sam Rockwell is in but either way, YUCK. Made by fans in Auckland, New Zealand.

The fortune teller reveals to Casey that his life line has been cut short, and says to him: "Beware, beware, in the darkest of dark  Not that it matters but I just want to say on the record that the first time I saw this when I was 17 or so that I knew nothing of it's controversy or anything about Victor Salva as a person. EDITOR’S NOTE: Bloody Disgusting has since decided it will no longer cover the Jeepers Creepers franchise or any of Victor Salva’s past, present, or future projects. ::: What I liked the best about the combined performances of Winters Mchugh and Rockwell, was that although their acting wasn't perfect, I actually believed them as brothers, the brother dynamic between them was very well captured and established, as were their individual characters and places in the brotherly hierarchy. The real terror with this movie is that the director, Victor Salva, is indeed a pedophile and actually harassed the lead actor in this. An old fashioned tell me a scary story film, shows other filmmakers that this is the right way to make a horror film. 		Directed By The only real colour in the shadowy room is the brilliant white of the face paint as one of them ominously smears it across his face, and it's like the donning of the warpaint! 	 For me "Clownhouse" is a great 80's horror film. Awards However, despite our courage and our rational explanations for the myths, monsters and things that go Bump in the night, there always remains that tiny voice which give credence to our doubts.

Salva served 15 months of a 3 year prison term and was released on parole. Salva videotaped one of the encounters. Somebody put Vic Salva and Dan Schneider in a cage fight to the death.     |                         Isolating it as a horror thriller, it is merely mild, though somewhat distinctive. And I must say, the only thing I did dislike about this film was Nathan Forest Winters, He was way too whiny, and so mumbly with his lines that most of the time I couldn't tell a word he was saying, and to me he just made for one very poor lead. The officers tell Casey that everything will be fine if he goes back to sleep, and hang up. Shenanigans ensue.
