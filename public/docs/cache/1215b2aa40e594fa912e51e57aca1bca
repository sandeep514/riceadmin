So why are so many remote Indigenous voters turning away from the ballot box? After weeks of political to-ing and fro-ing, Northern Territory voters head to the polls today to decide who will form government. Postal votes — of which about 3,000 had been received as of Friday afternoon — are expected to be counted on Sunday. coronavirus pandemic and cultural commitments, the first Indigenous speaker of an Australian Parliament, Labor played the pandemic card. Kate Brown discusses Oregon’s mail ballot system, telling voters across the country new to voting by mail to “vote early” and “make sure you have a plan.”. Labor is ahead in Arnhem and Daly, Territory Alliance is up in Araluen, with the CLP ahead in the remaining four. Or will the record number of early voters speed it up? Get the latest in election news, live updates, debates, candidates, issues, polls, analysis, and results. The answer is likely to come down to a handful of key electorates. Antony Green is the ABC's Chief Elections Analyst. The 2020 Northern Territory general election was held on 22 August 2020 to elect all 25 members of the Legislative Assembly  in the unicameral Northern Territory Parliament. Cash, cheque or money order accepted. Professor Bill Hing takes stock of the president's impact on immigration versus prior administrations. ", "That doesn't say good things about us as a society.". ABC News is your ultimate source for the 2020 Presidential Election. Plus, the facts about the Trump administration's handling of immigration. "We are the safest place in Australia, the best place in Australia," he said.  Then, a recount will take place on Monday. The CLP was left with just two seats after the 2016 NT election, so this IS a victory of sorts. Chief Minister Michael Gunner says he's "very confident" Labor will form the Northern Territory's next Government. But this election the CLP party has clawed back respectability in the electorate and is tipped to win, by ABC projections, up to six seats. But the commissioner, researchers and politicians themselves all said a more complex problem was at play. Here's where the election was won and what seats are still to be decided as vote counting enters a fourth day in the Northern Territory election. But the effort was hampered by a global pandemic that compressed its months-long enrolment and engagement campaign into a matter of weeks. Independent candidate for Arnhem Ian Gumbula, who is currently ahead after preferences in the seat with 47.4 per cent of the vote counted, could also join the balance-of-power independents if he upsets the Labor incumbent and Minister for Education and Aboriginal Affairs Selena Uibo. Chief Minister Michael Gunner faces the Country Liberal Party's Lia Finocchiario and former Chief Minister Terry Mills' Territory Alliance. Now it has to find solutions to the NT's problems, What happens now? ago. "It needs the Country Liberal Party to be that strong conservative voice for people right across the Northern Territory.". The ABC's election analyst Antony Green says NT Labor, led by Michael Gunner, will have the numbers to form a majority government now the party is expected to retain Arnhem and win the seat of Fong Lim. You might like … Why was the voter turnout only 74 per cent at the 2016 election? With just over 60 per cent of the vote counted, Labor is projected to win 11 seats and to form a majority would require wins in two of either Daly, Fong Lim, Barkly, Arnhem or Namatjira, which are all in play for the party. Now it's past midnight, counting has stopped for the night and will start again at 10am Sunday. "We're certainly not going to get anywhere close to [our goal]," Mr Loganathan said. Here are the four candidates who could hold the keys to the castle if Labor can't claw its way to 13 seats. The result was an emphatic rejection of party leader and former CLP chief minister Terry Mills, who was trounced in the seat of Blain where he will finish last. But will coronavirus social distancing rules slow the count? Labor Party. The party’s victory was forged in Darwin, where it won eight of its existing seats, plus a ninth seat previously held by Territory Alliance MLA Jeff Collins. "There are still a lot of votes to count, still a lot of votes to count, but if there is one thing I know, it is that the CLP is back," Ms Finocchiaro said. Ms Purick has denied any wrongdoing and despite the adverse finding is set to comfortably retain her rural Darwin seat of Goyder. Former Richmond player Bowden was elected to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly at the 2020 Johnston by-election. NT Labor will gain enough seats to form a majority government, with ABC election analyst Antony Green calling the seats of Arnhem and Fong Lim for the party. Senator for The Country Liberal Party Sam McMahon said she was "still not conceding" a loss. Territorians enjoy a good bit of shade when they can find it, but do political parties support making more? Territorians will today decide who takes the reins of power in the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory last fell under a minority government back in 2009 when the resignation of Alison Anderson from the then Labor government saw the balance of power fall into former independent MLA Gerry Wood's hands. We had CLP leading before (when you would have asked this question) because it was likely to come down to preferences and preferences would have pushed CLP ahead of Labor.

NT Votes: What are the parties doing about heat islands and tree cover? But the Northern Territory Electoral Commission (NTEC) entered this year's election with a comparatively modest goal of 80 per cent. ABC News channel will feature Live coverage of the Northern Territory election this Saturday. The ABC is projecting Labor will retain government with at least 12 seats as Territory Alliance leader Terry Mills is knocked over in the seat of Blain in an election upset. This program is not currently available in iview. The Labor Party has won 11 seats, two shy of governing in its own right. At the time, he scraped in with eight more votes than Labor's Lynne Walker. EFTPOS facilities also available. An NT Labor majority hangs in the balance as CLP claws back votes, What happened to Terry? At this stage, when exactly Araluen will be declared is anyone's guess.
