</html>";s:4:"text";s:6500:"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2015. Travelling or based outside United States? Great acting by John Houseman as a law professor who is trying to shape the undisciplined but bright students into disciplined lawyers and also by Timothy Bottoms as a bright but (somewhat) free spirited student. Of course, the Professor is a fictional character, but is supposedly a mixture of a number of actual Harvard Law faculty members. This is a compelling story on face, telling the tale of a young man struggling to adjust to life in law school, and life in the real world in general. The Paper Chase celebrates learning and what it means to be a good student. Performances are spot on throughout. But on a deeper level, it's the story of a generational struggle, the Baby Boomers against the children of the Great Depression. Kingsfield is the kind of superstar professor most well known universities have one or two of, and he's brilliant, aloof, intimidating and authoritative all presented in a personality full of the hauteur of one looking down from Olympus. There's a problem loading this menu right now. Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2016. Some of the best moments in the movie are when the law students are studying together. Rentals include 30 days to start watching this video and 48 hours to finish once started. John Houseman's Oscar winning performance as Harvard Law Professor Charles W. Kingsfield is the main draw of this film, but it's also a great time capsule of college life in the early seventies. It also analyzes reviews to verify trustworthiness. A confused but determined first year law student struggles to keep his head above water after he finds out that he is dating the daughter of his brilliant but hard-nosed Harvard professor who he desperately wants to impress. As much as some folks hated it, it was by far the best year of my life. The classroom scenes are pretty true to life in first-year law school, Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2014. I thought the love plot was silly. The Paper Chase is available to watch and stream, buy on demand at Amazon, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes, YouTube VOD online. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. Basically she is screen candy.

I believe the work of most first-year law professors in teaching by the Socratic Method,  do the same job as a Marine DI in boot camp:  Tears them down and rebuilds them. This movie is difficult to rate because in parts it earns a 5 and others a 2. A Great Film That Inspired Me Personally. Although made in the 70's it is as relevant today as then, of course time dilutes any films impact when viewed by a new generation but this really does hold up well. there aren't many people to like in this film, Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2017. This was an accurate depiction of the 70’s, although in state universities the stress level was rather lower. The Paper Chase is an Drama, Classics movie that was released in 1973 and has a run time of 1 hr 51 min. The Paper Chase (717) IMDb 7.2 1h ... the fact they take notes on paper in notebooks, and most of all the dorm, where there is one pay phone for all the students on the floor, who line up to use it ... which actually wasn't too bad for a "soapy" show, but never had the impact of this movie. I guess you have to like the struggle Hart goes through and then accept that he conquers it at the end when he doesn't end up caring about his grade.  Another thing the movie deals with is how hard it is for a good and serious student to find a balance between love and school. If You Give a Mouse a Cookie S01 E01 Mouse to the Rescue The Amazing Art Chase Prime members enjoy FREE Delivery and exclusive access to music, movies, TV shows, original audio series, and Kindle books. An excellent, intelligent and thought provoking film, and yes, it will make you smile too. The characters were still there then, and the experience was similar for me. There’s been for me. Other than that, however, the film is a gem. The Paper Chase is available to watch and stream, buy on demand at Amazon, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes, YouTube VOD online. Much cheaper than R2 so if you can play R1 go for this version, also includes audio commentary by the Producer. Video availability outside of United States varies. It was definitely a 70s movie. John Houseman is perfect as the law professor who is as brilliant as he is difficult, and it is hard to pass his class. It was inspirational to me I don’t know how law schools renow. Timothy Bottoms is a likeable student entering his first year of Law at Harvard, takes his work seriously, and believes Dr. Kingsfield has taken a personal interest in him. Reviewed in the United Kingdom on November 10, 2015. It has received moderate reviews from critics and viewers, who have given it an IMDb score of 7.2 and a MetaScore of 65.

The Paper Chase is an Drama, Classics movie that was released in 1973 and has a run time of 1 hr 51 min. The movie is about a first year law student at Harvard as he deals with the exhausting amount of studying he has to do, a difficult professor, and a love affair. As someone mentioned in a review a couple years ago, there aren't many people to like in this film. His other relationships consist entirely with the fellow students in his study group. The movie is good at showing how much work it is being a student, and how consistent and intense studying can drive a person crazy. Too young to see it when first released but many who did swear it changed their lives. Overall, I like the movie, but would not watch it frequently. In watching it again, I do agree with those who say the movie is very slow, possibly boring to some. I've never found her a convincing actress and this is no different. I never took part in a study group in law school, so I can't evaluate that part, but it showed the stress on the students very well, which is definitely a part of finals prep, as well as daily classroom experience, right down to the nervous glances by students sitting near the "victim" who's been selected to recite and "discuss" an assigned case.
