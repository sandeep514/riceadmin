</html>";s:4:"text";s:11103:"Horror films from the 90s to today. One of the pieces has been moved. 					 I hate to say it, but Salva is a pretty good director. But hey if Hollywood has taught me one thing it's that you never say never. While Frasier’s tag line is “I’m Listening,” Sonny employs the more nonsensical phrase, “There are no accidents” – which doesn’t really mean anything, nor does it sound like the type of thing a qualified psychiatrist would say to a patient. 					More details at Rosewood Lane is a missed chance with a nice plot twist, shame that it comes just a little too late to save the movie. The gimmicks are bad, the scares are not scary, the look is shiny and cheap. This movie has a fine touch with pacing. Sonny who was abused by her father is a traumatized woman receiving therapy from Dr. Cloey. The October Ordeal day #1b: Rosewood Lane, While Rosewood Lane's premise reads like that of a generic made-for-TV movie, Victor Salva nevertheless creates here a satisfying if lightweight and nonessential film. That night, after Barrett and the movers have left and Sonny is alone, the paperboy (Daniel Ross Owens, though why I’m putting his name down I don’t know. Could have done without the supernatural elements though, that make the paperboy into The Multiple Man (X-Men fans will get that reference). The only remotely scary thing in this psycho paperboy film is Rose McGowan's face. One of the dumbest movies ever made featuring the least competent display of policing in the history of policing. Scenes are predictable and characters act anything but the way they would in a real life situation. The exact plot is laid out in the first handful of minutes; the paperboy is a creepy stalker – and that’s it. Who needs a dog when you can have a cat? It looks like we don't have a Synopsis for this title yet. Directed by Victor Salva. Nice to see Rose on screen again, though. She arrives just as the grandfather clock is striking one a.m. She looks confused at a display of porcelain figures sitting up on her sink. TL;DR This is lame. It served no purpose, it wasn‘t coherent, it just made no fu3&ing…, The controversial Victor Salva(JEEPERS CREEPERS,POWDER) returns with this riveting suspense thriller about a radio talk show therapist(Rose McGowan[THE DOOM GENERATION,DEVIL IN THE FLESH]) who is attempting to recover from the death of her alcoholic father with whom she's had a troublesome relationship with,only that once she moves into his house she begins to get terrorized by a young psychotic killer(Daniel Ross Owens)who disguises himself as a teen newspaper delivery boy and his visits and disturbances into both her home and her life become more disrupting by the minute,who not only affect her but also her District Attorney boyfriend([the Chuck Zito looking]Sonny Marinelli),her lesbian radio station buddy(Lauren Velez),and a team of investigating cop detectives(Ray Wise[JEEPERS CREEPERS 2,TWIN PEAKS:FIRE WALK WITH ME],Tom…, Really glad they showed the street sign so many times because otherwise I probably would have forgotten what movie I was watching. Updated constantly. Feel free to make suggestions. The police, led by detective Briggs (Ray Wise) are inept at best and useless whenever Sonny needs them. Victor Salva is a pedophile. There was certainly plenty of evil abound here albeit in a more mischievous and juvenile way. Someone has been in her house…. Film data from TMDb. Or maybe for a totally non-scary horror film? It turns out that he is a cunning and dangerous sociopath, one who may have gruesomely killed her father - and others. After a moment of silence on the air, the caller whispers into the phone, “Hickory dickory dock…the mouse ran up the clock…the clock struck one the mouse ran down…hickory dickory dock.” Sonny is dismayed and the caller quickly hangs up. Doesn‘t anybody read scripts anymore? The host of the show is Dr. Sonny Blake (Rose McGowan) who mans the airwaves on the 8 p.m. -midnight shift every weeknight, doling out psychiatric advice to the listeners of the show. The Movie Buff, copyright 2011-2020 by Mark Ziobro and Matt DeCristo. Oh, and Maria LaGuerta as Rose McGowan's sassy sidekick. Anyway. Doors are left unlocked and ajar. As Sonny is getting ready for the movers, she strikes up a conversation with the elderly man who lives next door. We don’t know much about our villain but from early doors it…, Review by Mark "Trog Pint" Rogers   ★★★★   1. No one in the film showcases any great acting ability and the writing is appalling. And while…. Good evening and welcome fellow Children of Chaos. The man’s dog starts barking and Sonny looks up to see a mysterious boy sitting motionless on a bicycle watching her. The film plays out as an evil child film – one is reminded of Case 39 (2009), albeit with the central figure bumped up in age to their early teens. Matt's a writer and content creator for the site. I just couldn't help feeling my time swirl down the drain every minute that passed. That night on her show, the last caller is someone from Stillwater. Rose McGowan, known for her role on television’s “Charmed,” has matured into a beautiful, though obviously botoxed woman. At times I was watching this wondering if it was in the same universe as JEEPERS CREEPERS, there felt enough similarities in order for there to be a connection and our not at all wholesome paper boy could easily be from the same family as ‘The Creeper’ with the way he moves, uses regular transport techniques and acts. 					Directed by Victor Salva. This review was originally posted on Blogomatic 3000 . Check out mattdecristo.com and follow him on Instagram and Twitter @MattDeCristo. Sonny is in the process of moving back to her childhood home – the house from the beginning – and we learn that she is thedaughter of the man who fell to his death to start the movie. You haven’t seen him in anything before and you surely won’t be seeing him in anything of note for the rest of eternity) shows up acting all kinds of creepy. She thinks this is ridiculous, until she encounters the boy himself. Wonder no more! 1 out of 5 stars. Oh no. 				 Not quite. Assisting Sonny in the move is her would-be-suitor, District Attorney Barrett Tanner (Sonny Marinelli). That actors like Ray Wise or Lin Shaye were desperate enough to make something like this, is really sad. Had to pull a McMillan with this one and do the unthinkable: stop the movie before it's finished. Are you looking for the most stupid horror script ever written? It’s going to be that type of movie. There are better examples of this kind of movie, there are worse too. Shame on you! After Sonny encounters the paperboy in the beginning she goes to the local pound and does what any other woman living alone and in potential fear would do – she adopts a cat. Hickory dickory horseshit. Even if a bro on a bike makes for the least menacing antagonist possible, Salva's sharp genre instincts compensate nicely. One year after the death of her father, psychiatrist and radio talk show host Dr. Sonny Blake, returns to Rosewood Lane in Stillwater to live in his house. Luckily it was at a pawn shop so I don't think he saw any of my 1.99 I spent on this. The actor portraying the teenage paperboy will turn 30 this year, but that’s the least of the problems with this movie. Click here for instructions on how to enable JavaScript in your browser. Just wow! Tough on movies...not on films. His reviews offer insight on the art of filmmaking from the standpoint of a casual fan. She does a fine job, and Victor Silva is more than capable at directing a suspenseful, creepy Horror film. Detectives Briggs and Sabatino don't believe Sonny, thinking that it is her imagination. All the horror movies I need to get around to watching...eventually. 				 Made by fans in Auckland, New Zealand. Double, Double Toil and Trouble - Hoop-tober 3.0 (x2): 6/62.

Only mildly satisfying horror film from Jeepers Creepers director Victor Salva, Rosewood Lane sees Rose McGowen (who, thanks to poor surgery, looks like a partially melted Michael Jackson waxwork) besieged by the local paperboy (who is way too old to be a paperboy. So this was made by Jeepers Creepers' own Victor Salva. Showing all 2 items Jump to: Summaries (2) Summaries.

Get a real job!). I’m going to call bullshit on all the reviews that fault this movie because they find Rose McGowan’s post-accident face surgery too distracting. The story follows Dr. Sonny Blake (McGowan), a radio talk show psychiatrist, when she moves back to her childhood home after her alcoholic  father dies. Our story is home invasion mixed with the unknown. Nothing really makes sense, it's boring and completely ineffective. One year later, we are taken to a radio station where a prominent psychologist and author is concluding a nightly radio call-in show where listeners seek advice on an array of mental health topics. You get a couple halfway tense scenes, and one ok death. I'm not… You certainly have come to right place. She refuses and he runs off into the night. All in all I’d give it a 6..  As t least they confirmed what I suspected that it was twins or triplets….although I’ve never heard of identical trips. I'm gonna try, though, just to convey the utter ridiculousness of…. When radio talk show psychiatrist, Dr. Sonny Blake, moves back to her hometown, she takes notice of her neighborhood paper boy's unusual behavior. The deliberately hostile behaviour of the police, the behaviour of the dogs, the cruel past of the protagonist, the story of how the father died, the strange relationship to the ex-boyfriend, the sudden finale, the final „twist“... nothing. Like these people were all clearly the product of someone's imagination, have no true human characteristics, and therefore are not worth giving one single good goddamn about. “Rosewood Lane” confirms why her most famous role was that of coitus vixen to sideshow freak Marilyn Manson. Radio talk show therapist Sonny Blake (Rose McGowan) moves back to her childhood home on seemingly idyllic Rosewood Lane after her alcoholic father dies. This review may contain spoilers. The behind-the-scenes featurette is gross. Includes Featured Feline Monster and Kitty Carnage Warning! But upon arrival in the old neighborhood, Sonny discovers her neighbors are terrified of the local paperboy (Daniel Ross Owens).
