They see details that you or I never see, but that speak to the project as a whole… And finessing those details took a lot of time… We reached out to one of our buddies Andy Catarisano and he completely reworked the edit from the ground up to allow for Dan & Salomon to do what they are amazing at! Noam Kroll is an award-winning Los Angeles based filmmaker, and the founder of the boutique production house, Creative Rebellion. #testfootage #alexaplus #blackandwhi, Behind the scenes - David Thies (@tvacom) with Shi, Light slivers #goldenhour #bluehour #shotoniphone, TRUE ROMANCE. Then when we got contacted by Dallas Taylor from Defacto Sound about sound design – I can’t even express where the film went. Abby was also chipped that season, meaning there was a possibility that her version of the code interacted with Simone’s Mind Drive, even though the EMP used to destroy the chip should have also removed the mesh. Before the finale aired, there was speculation that a part of Abby may still exist. What is amazing about platforms like Kickstarter is that it helps capitalize on your social media following… We were hoping the entire process that our campaign would be seen by Kickstarter themselves and they would feature us, but that never happened… The ones who made this a success and supported us was our network of friends & family who believed in us… Even when we probably fully didn’t believe in ourselves. So where did the Flame go? At first it might seem another group of humans somehow made their way to Sanctum even further back, but the appearance of Hope and events from earlier in the season suggest otherwise. Throw in some time travel mumbo jumbo and the sphere gets its origin. In the end we shot on lomo primes. NK: It’s incredible that you’ve been able to tap into all sorts of different niches online to spread the word on your film – from having the Vimeo community rally around you, to releasing the soundtrack on The Music Bed. I’m so sorry Octavia. NK: The incredible music and sound design obviously played a huge role in the mood and texture of this film. Currently indie film is thought of as one big market, but if you think about what an actual independent film is, it usually comes in a package of a private investor and maintains an average budget of a million more or less… But that’s not who our peers are. How many shoot days? JJ: Actually not at all funny you should ask! The man and the machine One major theme that came to the fore as the series reached its conclusion had … I was able to do it from a hack through an iPhone. Meanwhile, Dr Gabriel Montrose learns the origin of an approaching comet through the story of his reclusive predecessor Noel Fitz. Michael Koczwara is a freelance writer who is happy The 100 is getting a definitive end. So in the end most of our money went into locations, travel/logistics, and I can’t tell you how much a difference it made to put a lot of our budget into locations & production design. I’d be scared of getting on that ship next season! In the first movie, the Planet Of The Apes had been Earth all along. This year’s Season 6 came with a healthy dose of mind control, a generous sampling of redemption, and your usual cliffhanger leaving you utterly confused until next year. I never have been motivated by money and that should never dictate your decisions starting out… Do what you can with what you have, and push yourself harder than anyone else can. JJ: To be honest post production became an extremely difficult process as we had a zero budget for post as the Directors were initially going to edit it themselves. Gabriel describes the sphere as being thousands of years old. How big was the crew? While a number of stories wrapped up, not everything was explained in full detail, with certain plotlines left hanging in the air. It really is a full flex marketing campaign and you need to be prepared for it. Noel Clarke's latest effort mixes a Matrix-style plot with downmarket DVD tactics with underwhelming results. Time travel seems to be the more obvious answer. JJ: You know what’s funny, in my head I was kicking myself for why we didn’t try to raise more. Brian Cox is all too fleeting as the enigmatic eminence grise. Hope: I couldn’t get out of it. The collapse of the anomaly caused the ships cores to be breach, but once it collapsed it didn't matter, as the result of what the future timeline had done to cause the problem in the first place had been reversed, causing the past and present to … Here's the ending of the Matrix trilogy explained. What kind of gear did you shoot on, and why? Or Are We Actually Chasing The 'Alexa' Look, Could The Samsung NX1 Be The Next Best DSLR For Video? JJ: Our Writer & Director Salomon has an extensive background in music from sound design to scoring, so I knew from the beginning that his talents in those areas would play a huge part in the film… But even still, I didn’t know how far that was really going to go. Clarke casts himself as traumatised antihero Ryan, an ex-soldier experiencing life in interrupted staccato bursts as his brain is messed with by futuristic forces. Make opportunities for yourself. All we get are confused faces and not a single other mention in the rest of the episode. Can you shed light on where the budget was spent and what resources, favors or other help you had along the way that let you keep more money on the screen? NK: I’m sure that any aspiring filmmakers reading this would love some words of wisdom. And just like that, another season of The 100 has come to an end. As Haley makes sense of her unplanned pregnancy, she must decide whether to trust fate or succumb to the will of a man. It’s hard for me to say if this is going to be a sustainable model as we are just currently going through it ourselves. The Anomaly review – ambitious but uneven sci-fi romp Noel Clarke's latest effort mixes a Matrix-style plot with downmarket DVD tactics with underwhelming results 'Maximum bangs for … There they find a floating metallic sphere with spiral designs and the same type of pattern found on Octavia’s tattoo inscribed on its outside. Below is my interview with Jens Jacob, who truly went above and beyond to help make this film what it is today: NK: I’d love to start out by hearing about your impressive development and fundraising process, in which you were able to pull together over $60K on Kickstarter. Safe passage on your travels, Abby. It’d be surprising to leave the Flame storyline in a weird state like this so it’s likely it will return in some fashion next season, probably when the “sleeping army” comes back into play. Using the red symbols on Octavia’s newly found tattoo as a code, Gabriel is able to activate the sphere, causing the anomaly to expand. Plus, get a free Super 16mm film grain for signing up! (C) 2020 - Creative Rebellion, Inc. All Rights Reserved. What many people have to realize about Kickstarter is that it’s not a magical site that you post your project to and random people will come find you. Film festivals in my opinion really need to change their model in the up & coming years as with this Internet revolution, its hard for me to believe people are going to stay on board with this process and timeline. Take note, the following will be a deep dive into some heavy SPOILERS so be wary if you are not caught up! Exlusive filmmaking content delivered every Sunday. This means the creators of the sphere could not have been anyone from the Eligius Corporation as the first settlers arrived around 250 years prior. The Anomaly is a decent film, a near-future world filled with interesting biotech concepts and a great scene-chewing villain, but a little more character-building to better explain some of the motivations — and maybe a little more time to explore those … But I beg to say that there is now a 3rd category of fully self created projects, widely seen in the “Vimeo” market. The success of the film naturally was a result of the talent and dedication of the entire team, who worked long and hard to bring this project to life. That said, we did try to keep everything as organic as possible and didn’t want to force anything… Having some sort of structure always pushes you in the right direction, and a lot of that comes from having lots of mini goals, and trying to meet them to propel you towards your dream… We were fortunate to have people that truly believed in the project stand with us, such as The Music Bed who supported us every step of the way from the Kickstarter campaign all the way through to the release. Within minutes of it’s release, the film started racking up thousands upon thousands of views on Vimeo before eventually getting staff picked and shared on countless sites and blogs – all the while receiving extremely high praise from viewers and filmmakers alike.

The reason we even had so much for travel was to go to the best possible locations we could. Bellamy: Octavia, what’s happening? JJ: A lot of how Anomaly was created was really just setting expectations of it being a passion project and being as resourceful as possible! We really wanted to set a distinct tone for Anomaly as it was a period piece and Dan, Salomon & Khalid being such visual creatives wanted to go with Anamorphic’s. VFX I can’t even begin to talk about, as it was one of the craziest parts of the process… Thanks to Dan’s hard work & dedication he was able to pull off the supervising of over 20 artists who were working from all parts of the world from their homes, as well as 2 VFX houses – one of which is located in London. Premium articles, filmmaking tools and access to giveaways all available FREE by signing up for my newsletter below. JJ: I think we live in such an awesome time, and there has never been a better time to be a filmmaker in my opinion! It was a one way schedule just hitting one city to the next, and we really didn’t have an off day as we shot even on travel days. It was crowdfunded, produced, released online, and extremely well received by the very audience that supported the film from the beginning. JJ: In early pre-production we knew that we wanted to shoot in 3 different states, purely because what those areas offered for production value was fantastic. And as someone that has a few friends and colleagues that were very involved in the creation of this film, I am extremely happy to see just how successful it has become. It was so packed that if we missed even one beat the rest of the production would fall like dominos. We had to do as much as we could in the least amount of days as possible! My biggest reward is reading the comments online and hearing what people got out of it, as well as sitting with family and friends to watch it… We are hoping it will reach as much people as possible that could even use the message behind it. The film’s directors were able to successfully raise (and exceed) their $60K kickstarter goal, produce a film that looks like it was shot with many times that budget, and ultimately release it online for the world to see. JJ: We Hope ANOMALY will have a life of its own now. It was the first time that any of us really did a Kickstarter so we had no idea what we were doing, but we did what we knew how to do which is create and share… Our Kickstarter video created by Dan & Salomon our directors is widely what I credit the success of the Kickstarter campaign to.
