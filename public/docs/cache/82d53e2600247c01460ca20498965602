Allan is dispossessed by Fabinho in the Everton half, the ball makes its way to Salah who cuts in on his left. <br> <br>Allan and Andre Gomes come back into the side as Tom Davies and Glyfi Sigurdsson make way. <br> <br>Dominic Calvert-Lewin held his nerve when it counted to bury the equaliser. Rodriguez plays a superb ball across the pitch, Digne drives in a low cross and Calvert-Lewin fails to make any contact on it! #EVELIV. On the hour, Richarlison’s diving header from James’s sumptuous cross came off the post. Although the team is waiting for confirmation, beIN Sports is reporting that the Reds' star defender is looking at a seven-to-eight month recovery. <br> <br>Ferguson was Everton's interim manager for a brief period before Ancelotti's arrival in December. <br> <br>Alexander-Arnold goes for goal, but it goes high and wide. To make matters worse for Everton, Richarlison seems to be struggling with a knock too. <br> <br>Yet then came the interminable wait. #EVELIV. Another save from Pickford! <br> <br>Another chance for Jurgen Klopp's side. <br> <br>‘We just sit here and you discuss it with me.

Var has failed on every level today. Fair call. Still on ! They attack again, this time Gomes is caught offside. Perhaps he is not his usual self... Richarlison hits the post! <br> <br>If there is one side that can match Liverpool’s exciting front three it is Everton, with Richarlison, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and James Rodriguez all in form. 86min: Free-kick for Liverpool on the corner of the box but Trent Alexander-Arnold can only bend it wide of the near post. As it is, it feels like we are back where English football left off: despairing at the flawed human application of technology that seems to have made things worse. Richarlison is staying on. A VAR check shows that Sadio Mane was fractionally offside. <br> <br>Pickford has got away with that. <br> <br>EXCLUSIVE: The 23-year-old provided a telling insight into the issue in football and society to help the Premier League launch the second phase of their No Room For Racism initiative. From the subsequent James Rodriguez corner, Keane out-jumped Fabinho to head in the equaliser. <br> <br>And then there was VAR. Carlo Ancelotti doesn't even give him a glance as he walks off. Everton 2-3 Liverpool (Henderson 90+2) 9.22am EDT 09:22 RED CARD! That evidence appeared to reveal Mane level before he crossed for the goal that would have given Liverpool victory against the 10 men of Everton. 37min: Everton look like they need half=time. <br> <br>First threat on goal from Everton but Dominic Calvert-Lewin can't steer his header on target. <br> <br>You can add the ‘Big Sport’ package for £40 per month which includes all BT Sport and 11 Sky Sports channels via a NOW TV pass. At the end of it all, there was the din of industrial lawnmowers working overtime at an otherwise silent Goodison Park. <br> <br>The Scot said he was immediately impressed by the veteran manager. Andy Dunn, the Mirror's chief sports writer says that Everton proved they can rival neighbours Liverpool this season with their derby display. Salah attempts a shot under pressure in the box following the free kick, Godfrey blocks it behind for a corner.  <br>You would have put a lot of money on him scoring, given his form, from six yards out. [1-2]#EVELIV https://t.co/S74jIJi2TV. <br> <br>And Coleman is coming off, replaced by new signing Ben Godfrey! A low cross is cleared by Mina. A dramatic derby in which Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford contributed to excitement. There is going to be space for Liverpool to counter and kill the game now. Seconds later he denies Salah again. An exceptional first-time strike from Salah gives us the lead. <br> <br>It's an absolutely fantastic, masterful finish by Salah. While Liverpool probably thought they deserved a win, this was a game that showcased two very talented teams. Liverpool head to high-flying Everton on Saturday for one of the most eagerly anticipated Merseyside derbies in years. Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Matip, Van Dijk, Robertson, Henderson, Fabinho, Thiago, Salah, Firmino, Mane.Subs: Wijnaldum, Milner, Gomez, Jones, Minamino, Jota, Kelleher. He never did it. Everton should score! <br> <br>Mane wins a free kick on the edge of the Everton box as Gomes raises a high boot just as Mane went to head it.                              Liverpool should score! Pickford should have been sent off for that!!! Calvert-Lewin! <br> A fabulous header from Dominic Calvert-Lewin  #MyPLMorning pic.twitter.com/fubRSTIs89. #EVELIV pic.twitter.com/7jHoCQuo9Q, 1989 - This is the first top-flight Merseyside derby with Everton starting the day top of the table since September 1989, when Liverpool won 3-1 at Goodison Park thanks to goals from Ian Rush (2) and John Barnes.                              Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.     9:17 am ET, at <br> <br> pic.twitter.com/kgxj2T8rEq, 70' - WHAT A FINISH! "The first thing I noticed when he came in was that he never changed anything. Calvert-Lewin has developed a physical presence in the box and seems to be reading the game better. Given that they conceded seven against Aston Villa last time out, the defence is will certainly be under scrutiny today. It is an honour for us play against them. <br> <br>Carlo Ancelotti expressed his sympathy for Van Dijk but would not be drawn on Pickford. Everton attack once more, the Colombian puts his cross into the hands of Adrian. Klopp could rely on two marvellous finishes from Mane and Mohamed Salah for his team’s two goals. Liverpool win a corner, a header is direct into the bottom corner and somehow Pickford keeps it out! Take a look: Liverpool lo ganaba en la última pero el gol de Henderson fue anulado por este "offside" de Mané. <br> <br>We scored a goal one time at Aston Villa and they said the armpit was offside -- sounds funny, we got it," Klopp said. It feels a very even contest, both teams feel equally likely to score next.                              That was a clinical finish. <br> <br>That was Salah's 100th goal for Liverpool, what a time to do it! <br> <br>Liverpool rammed home their dominance. In the 80th minute, Digne provided the inviting cross and Calvert-Lewin, seemingly hanging mid-air, towered above Robertson. The pressing was back to being the well-engineered machine. The high line is likely to remain, although there has been a change to personnel with Joel Matip replacing Joe Gomez. Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group. No image available could establish an offside, except one available to the VAR, who apparently could detect a part of the shoulder offside. The result keeps Everton in first place, and for that reason, they'll be the happier of the two. You will not see a clearer sending-off this season. <br> <br>11min: Van Dijk's day is done. <br> <br>They went down twice, got lucky with VAR and should have gotten two red card.     9:09 am ET, at #awlfc [bein sports] pic.twitter.com/2VEsAwxOAF, "I don't know [how serious it is], I don't know, but it is not good. <br> <br>It is important to know what your rights are when it comes to fireworks. <br> <br>Kick off time, live stream and latest team news, Premier League Project Big Picture – The cost of survival is the death of competition, Who are the big six in the Premier League?

Mane whips in a cross and Henderson is beaten to it.
