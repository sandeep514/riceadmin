</html>";s:4:"text";s:10081:"<br>Thanks S. Generally agree, though it’s not the case on the cutters really. Like most new openings, he sought to create a modern environment. A question on prices. Lastly please don’t forget to write about the oft forgotten trousers – there is barely a mention until the comments wherein we realise that they come with braces (v. unusual for you as you will appreciate) and hence the double pleats. <br> <br>Did you find that cut fit you better and so you requested it? Peter, If the difference is that large, then yes I would go to a different tailor. My sense is that with a tuxedo, one normally would have flat front trousers to maximize simplicity. The jacket is quite long (one of the longest I have, at 32¼ inches) which is consistent with the Huntsman style. <br> <br>I was quite looking forward to trying the new range at some point. <br> <br>A series of direct measures are taken, and a customer’s individual and unique paper pattern is constructed considering posture and figuration. <br> <br>I still wear it regularly, I prefer it my other dinner suits ,it’s nearly always commented on and I still am delighted to wear it. <br> <br>This fabric was created in the Thirties and supplied to the RAF to protect pilots  and is still used by NATO today. I am not a huge fan of the sheen that comes from the satin lapels and prefer a more matted look. <br> <br>It’s the cut, rather than how it stands out or rolls. But yes, they are at different ends of the spectrum! <br> <br>My question now is, how does one know if the back of a suit is fine or not? <br> <br>Thanks. On the drape I assume that this is something to do with the crispness of the fabric? <br> <br>Thanks Simon. The traditions come from Anderson’s time at Huntsman where he was trained by the legendary head cutter Colin Hammick and worked with clients such as Stewart Granger (very sweary), Rex Harrison (very demanding) and Katharine Hepburn (very wonderful). Sleeves should be 1/2” longer. That is very much a matter of taste, however, and others might see this modest, understated style as perfect for something that – at heart – is meant to be elegant and simple: an accompaniment to any female companion, rather than a rival for attention. As has been noted, the trousers have forward facing pleats. Any notable differences between this and the current Huntsman cut? Would you ask Richard to change anything on the suit if you had it made today?I just wonder if your ideas on style have altered much over the years.For example,are you still happy with the jackets length or the width of the trousers bottoms,say 15″ today? Richard Anderson cut me this three-piece, peak-lapel tuxedo in 2014. Some very talented cutters indeed working at all the various houses. Although Richard’s output is always expanding, the atmosphere at 13 Savile Row remains cosy, with everything under Richard’s watchful eye. <br> <br>Most of these are around that, most the variety is just photography. What weight cloth did you select? So I suggest we leave it to them rather than remote speculation. <br> <br>Why do you give a price and a starting price? <br> <br>I’m a bit confused at these comments because everything here is done by the book. Having an updated price rather than 2014 is great but feels more onerous than saying what its price was at the time you had it made. <br> <br> <br>If I may pass on some feedback, I particularly valued your commentary around the “X” shape and what plays into that with this suit, the commentary around how some fullness in the chest is created. <br> <br>Simon, New Dartmoor colour – and what to wear underneath. Richard Anderson is an independently run bespoke tailoring retailer based at 13 Savile Row, London, offering bespoke garments, ready to wear suits, accessories, shirts, jackets and more. For my tux I opted for a mohair/wool cloth, tempted by the sharpness of the mohair, and in black rather than the now more fashionable midnight blue. <br> <br>If you dislike the sheen of satin (which I do too) then I would go with grosgrain. The lapels on the jacket have silk facings, it’s just that the body has so much sheen that there’s not much contrast with the lapels. Both these things could be used to give an impression of fullness or roundness to the chest. No, the starting price is for a 2-piece suit, not a three-piece tux. <br> <br>Monday to Friday 9am – 5 pm The price quoted for a dinner suit is ludicrous. A little, yes, but it’s not as big a difference as the shoulder or chest, Hi, I completely appreciate your point, but we've talked over this area so much, and nothing changes - there is no bias on my part, and most readers don't perceive a bias either. I actually met you in person at a Cerrato ‘trouser afternoon’ in London in the summer where I was getting a pair of evening trousers made. In the chest there will be a layer of body canvas running the length of the body, a layer of horsehair just at the top, and then demette over the top of that. Interesting. <br> <br>Thanks. <br> <br>My issue is more to do with style; it’s complex with idiosyncrasies that don’ quite chime. This is a big area, which we've probably written over 500 articles about, but I'd suggest you start with the Guide…, The guide to shirt collars – and what suits you, Click on an image to enlarge. <br> <br>I don’t regret the black, and the mohair has remained crisp, but in retrospect I think I might have enjoyed a pure wool more. I wonder if a limit will be reached soon. Main reason why I went to Richard for a commission, you fairly know what you will get and no need to follow the cutter to various houses if he is the owner of the house! In patent leather, they’d seem about right. And because a DB can be very flattering but hard for some to wear in offices. I understand why it is cut this way (to match the jacket line) but why then use at all? Between them the tailors at Richard Anderson have over 100 years of experience and the house style has been specifically designed to … <br> And the vent is a touch shorter than average (10 inches). Simon could you explain a little more about the properties of mohair / wool? <br> <br>Thanks, and excited to see the rest of this series! Beautiful but a heck of a price. <br> <br>Thanks! Simon – hope you’re well. I find the events at which I wear my dinner jacket are usually pretty warm. <br> <br>What is going on with price inflation in bespoke today? and for me the trousers should be flat fronted and cut a little closer (though Simon has set out his reasons for that). Beautiful lines, understated and completely flawless. None of those things are required for an X shape across the body. <br> <br>If you can afford to spend the thick end of £8,000 on a suit then average wage increases and inflation aren’t likely to have much of a baring on your income. Can you clarify this for me? <br> <br>If you were a groom and would wear this in the evening, what would be your footwear of choice? Opera pumps on black tie, in this day and age, are a massive affectation. <br> <br>Of course if you have a jacket shortened I think its difficult to have it lengthened again as there isn’t cloth at the front curve so you are stuck. It’s a good opportunity to wear a double breasted jacket. I think as a house style C&M they tend to exaggerate theirs so it would be nice to know the difference to get some perspective? It’s not going to feel as nice as 100% wool. <br> <br>They needed to position themselves in the top-earning bracket and the world of easy money when they made the transition from craftsmen to artists/designers. I wouldn’t ever go jacketless, no Bruno, and I guess the photo is a little misleading in that respect. I think the price increasea not only relate to increased rent but availability of a new group of customer (Asians etc) who are more price insensitive. Compared to other English tailors, the style is perhaps best described as understated: straight up-and-down, without any exaggerated lines or sharp cutaways. <br> <br>Arm holes are cut high for ease of movement and to create extra length through the side seam.Ladies: Our tailored line is elegant, comfortable and practical, using traditional tailoring and couture methods with additional darts for a universally flattering silhouette. It’s difficult to see for sure in the picture on this post and you didn’t discuss it much within the post – but does it matter if you have a collar on evening wear waistcoats or not? When ia enough enough when it come to prices? <br> <br>Lining attached to the facings by hand, side seams in the lining by hand, centre seam by machine. Saturday 10am – 5pm I do quite like the low key facing on the coat lapels though, quite stealth. As Anderson wrote in his memoir Bespoke: Savile Row Ripped And Smoothed, “Show me a lobotomist who can work to a sixteenth of an inch using ten-inch shears.”. <br> <br>The gorge sits almost 5 inches from the shoulder seam, which average for Savile Row, but low by the standards of many contemporary suits. They’re somewhat close to opera pumps, but less affected (at least to me, particularly without the little bow tie). <br> <br>What’s your opinion on double breasted dinner jackets? <br> <br>I’m really looking forward to other episodes. <br> <br>Might be completely on the wrong thread but couldn’t find a relevant one. <br> <br>I really enjoyed talking with Richard, and particularly Brian [Lishak] about the style aspects of the tux. Although Richard’s output is always expanding, the atmosphere at 13 Savile Row remains cosy, with everything under Richard’s watchful eye. In some cases they’ve almost doubled. Richard kept it relatively hidden, with the back seam quite straight. Thoughts? From your blog, you refer to the “cut” as creating it, so I’ve always assumed it had to do with how the outer edge of the lapel is shaped. This series will be a great reference work for years to come.
