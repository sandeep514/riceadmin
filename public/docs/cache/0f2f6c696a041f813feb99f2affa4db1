</html>";s:4:"text";s:10574:" dihan Apr 10 2016 4:50 am  dont try to get yi an and eunbi together with stupid method please......... ruby May 26 2015 2:35 am  100% Yi An and Eun Bi. Yian hadn't loved Eunbyul for 10 years. vipsone Jun 10 2015 5:23 pm  after all this teen drama, so its doesnt make same yi an would fall in love wif eun bi now.. well after all eun byul is his first loveÂ ! Tae-gwang pretends not be concerned despite being secretly worried about Eun-byeol. Angel Zhou Jun 24 2015 12:37 am  Mayakho May 26 2015 9:14 pm  I think that new student teacher has some kind of relationship with soo in, remember last time massage from soo in, before that time student teacher and class teacher at same place, bt when the massage cm she was outside with her phone and doing something, and same time both teacher & eun bi got the massge .. nini May 22 2015 9:02 pm  At first I really don't care if Eun Bi ends up with Yi-An or Tae-Gwang because for me they're both handsome, oh well haha. For me it could go either way. told u guys right.. Yi An totally going insane with the truth tht current eun byul not eun byul his childhood love... i do feel bad for yi an, how he hope tht all those twins things not true. School 2015 is such a good drama. sera Oct 13 2019 11:58 am  Also crush soo young for good. if yi an will end up with eunbi it's seems like drama "my lovely girl" -_-. Oh yeah, he keeps thinking she's Eun Byul. sick family! please take revenge for your sister!!! I expect he would react at least half of how her mom react... unfortunately he just seems upset, why? I love Yi An since beginning seeing his deep love which i never expect to changes in the end... so dissapointing! and she even decided to comeback their school!! does that mean she chose yian?? This Rating to this kdrama . WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I know Eun Bi have feeling with yi an but look back and thing again who like you the way you are!! I know many of the viewers ships eun ni an tae kwang. That 10 years love means nothings so why monthly love means somethings? well, its just my opinion. dadz May 10 2015 1:56 am  Diana Jun 16 2015 9:55 am  cim Jun 16 2015 2:50 pm  I just hope that eun byul ended with yi an and eun bi ended with tae kwang. She's sooo pretty! I have feeling on how the series gonna end chances is that it either going to be an open ending or unhappy ending. sana May 14 2015 4:53 am  Jung Soo In's death is still a mystery for me though. Firstly, I don't think Eun Bi love Yi An. i really hope that eun bi and gong tae will end up together. Yi An is perfect. As you said, Yi An likes the sassy Eun Byul. Tae Kwang is a guy who has never received true empathy, warmth, kindness, or affection. i guarantee you, most viewer is eunbi taekwang shipper.. (LOL, i just read comments here, and fulfilled by eunbi taekwang shipper). kim so hyun is a freakin badass actress. I hope they would have clarified why YIBI should end 2gether as I really did not understand it. Probably the same thing happen to Eun Bi when she was once famous trying to protect the outcast and got into trouble. pinkichigo1112 May 13 2015 3:08 am  Eun Byul is Yi An's childhood crush and so is Yi An for Eun Byul. Please yi an realizeÂ ! It's better than make Eunbi with Yian, really mess ending. Deniz Jun 02 2015 3:20 am  Alison was physically not there, but she was what the show was about. ohho Jun 13 2015 1:04 pm  Keira Jan 09 2017 2:24 pm  Don't make me frown anymore, stop doing things that are heartbreaking gdi I feel badÂ ;;;; But yeah I believe, I BELIEVEEEEEE~~ lol that Gongtae is not like the second male lead who breaks our heart like oahbdcihdqbchwf. He is a wounded knight after all, who well do everything, he can to protect his princess. It can't be change easily right? he likes eunbi but not to the extend of loves, he has memories with eunbi but not as much as eunbyul... so its not possible to switch his feeling now! I wish there is an alternate universe for Taekwang Eunbi... at least in fmv In episode 4, the authorities that Eun Bi called said they found a corpse and they must have buried it under Eun Bi's name. Most of the viewers wanted tae kwang and eun bi to end up together but sadly they didn't. Great actors and actresses! byunbaekhyunnie May 13 2015 9:06 am  MAGDIWANG! OMFG! She getting flusttered in the end of the eps.. pinkichigo1112 May 27 2015 7:39 pm  Haha. Watching ep 15 really make me so sad. stella Jun 26 2015 1:41 pm  I love this drama so much, before this i would say i don't like high school drama because my age hihiÂ :p i love main cast Eun Bi/ Byul, Te Kwang and Yi Ahn and the story itself. I think it was the writers' bitter side that didn't let them end up with one another. Also, I don't believe either of the sisters will die. :) Thank you for entertaining us! TaeBi shippers here! kyra Apr 01 2015 8:01 pm  I will support this Kdrama even if Yi Byul end up together! Good for u kang so young.. go eun byul, please hit kang so young for me.. she's really mean to your twin sister.. Kimosa Jun 08 2015 11:42 pm  Just that Yi-an and Tae-kwang are getting closer. Kneel Sep 11 2015 1:47 am  i dont know why. And after i watch ep 6 i hope eun bi and tae kwang become couple. Every time she went against soo young to protect eun bi... she was really cool. its just showed.. viewer really appreciate this drama alot. Cheers to YiBi! Well i think that eun byul is dead.. and eun bi is the one who will discover the truth behind this... come on there is a grave already are u telling me they she made up her death?? naireonnamjaya Apr 06 2015 9:09 am  Madcatz Jun 09 2015 10:49 pm  excited for the next episode, lee min nae May 30 2015 12:58 am   Unlike Eun Byul who being cool about her sisters being in love with her bestfriend (bestfriend who she think she gonna regret for not realize her feelings earlier) and accept Yi An decision to end his one-side love (because of he in love with her own twins sister), Tae Kwang being made a fool! Kami menyajikan tontonan drakor paling cepat dan paling terkomplit, di dukung dengan player ringan, para pecinta drakor bisa menikmati keringanan di sini hanya dengan menggunakan chrome â¦ but.. I reallllllly realllllllllllllllly want Eun Bi to end up with Tae Kwang!!! I know he is the second guy (or is he??) EunTae couple fighting! ommo please stay alive. And even IF they were two actos, the fact remains Eun Byul is the main driving point and not Eun Bi. So Gong Tae founds out and talks to his father that he would do anything (and would go study abord if his father wants to) as long as he does not expell her from school. And Yi Ahn? maybe she wants to make eun byul drop out segang school like push her to told the truth about past which is happened with so in's death.. thts why so in's mom told in ep 8 i think if im not forget when she is in eun byul;s mom store tht she wants to buy her daughter clothes, i think its for so in's eunni. That was not so bad for him. But eun byeol even she has many problem she doesnt tell anyone, she doesnt want anyone worried about her, she keep her pain in herself. i know that feeling. Bullying is bad and at 18 years old, there is a lot of thing to learn and discover beside Love! siggy Jul 17 2015 12:17 pm  If this is the way to make the drama memorable, guess what? Now i need to be patient for a whole week to wait for ep 11 which could be veryyyyy interesting!!! And now Yian falling in love with eunbi? fighting!!!!!   LOL. And let Eun-Bi and Tae-Gwang together because they really have a good chemistry. Everyone has the right to say whatever they want. yamira May 19 2015 1:36 pm  . If he goes to eunbi, eunbyul doesnt have anyone that she can depends on anymore (we can see how much YA means for her though eunbyul doesnt show her affection towards him like how eunbi show). Really, the show can end with Yi An/Eun Bi or Eun Bi/Tae Gwang or Eun Byul/Yi An (Eun Byul/Tae Gwang i'm isolating because it's ridiculous in my eyes and I would be more than angry if they suddenly push these two together). or it is make audiences confuse and more expect this drama? then its normal things to do since love is blind? This drama is really great. jako May 25 2015 8:27 am  Gosh i really love this drama. It sometimes over shadowed the main lead. but still it's worth to watch! she's alive.....yeah!! A friend that will help anything if she have a problem. And this Love Triangle annoys me. Violence vs Violence is wrong.. Another wrong does not make it right. its really the best drama i love han yi an and also cute kong tae gwang meme May 25 2015 6:32 pm  Yi An has protected her many times and has been there for her, but we have to think about the fact that he's done most of that when he believed Eun Bi to be Eun Byul. Mizuki May 27 2015 1:32 am  Are you guys know? I was just waiting for her to come back, and there She is.. han yi an really loved eun bi after all , unlike his one-sided love with eun byoel. Fraulein xiong May 27 2015 3:01 pm  writer can you make she appear and not make she died because its make thing more interestin, ri hyo May 19 2015 10:27 am  I think that for this show, the ensemble cast doesn't necessarily have to be acclaimed actors or anything. koi koi Jun 25 2015 10:12 pm  All rights reserved. But the way eun bi is getting hurt by cruel girls is so pathetic. I actually think too that Eun Byul saved Eun Bi and saw that as a chance to swap their lifes. 	 Taebi Jun 16 2015 5:21 am  When Eun Byul come back Yi An is already in love with Eun Bi. so its not necessary for eun bi to end up with yi an right? don't get me wrong, so, this is my reason, Yi An, without understanding anything, misunderstood EunByul's part. I'll never understand why these people being bullied are always such cowards. huhuhu I hope my prediction above is wrong please please pleaseÂ :(, Akire Chua Jun 08 2015 11:33 pm  I am also waiting.......... Also, something left unexplained. and I am so sad because next week this drama will end . I knew Eun Byul was not dead. i haven't watched it, but i'm very happy that eunbyul didn't die (saw others spoiler), cz i really sad when i saw ep 9, i want ship taebi but i'd feel poor for yian. A JOB WELL DONE!! i hope they'll make more of these types of endings and have warm-hearted actors like nam joo hyuk. Junge sung- sung Jun 05 2015 3:16 pm  But I need my TaeBi couple to get together. Honestly i love YiByul couple more than TaeBi couple.. till the end i keep telling myself Yi An and Eun Byul made a great couple and YiBi just boring.. How could first love lose to confused love?
