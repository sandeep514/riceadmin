So this transaction preserves consistency ACID properties in DBMS. statements C and D would be committed, while statements A, B, E, and F would be rolled back. before statement C executed, the changes were not committed before statement C. However, statements E and F see changes made in statements C and D because changes If you do decide to group unrelated Snowflake recommends keeping AUTOCOMMIT enabled and using explicit transactions as much as possible. If you are preparing the database companies like Oracle, IBM DB2, you can find lots of interview question on this topic. Combining multiple statements into a single transaction can improve performance. Let me take the above example to explain this SQL ACID property. In that case, changes made while transactions should persist. Each SQL Although Snowflake supports nested procedure calls, Snowflake does not support nested transactions; However, deadlocks can occur with explicitly-started transactions and multiple statements in each transaction. With READ COMMITTED isolation, a statement sees only data that was committed before the statement began. that the other transaction made in statements A and B because even though those changes were made By passing appropriate parameters, the caller block other statements from modifying the resource until the lock is released.

ACID transactions were a big deal when first introduced formally in the 1980s in monolithic SQL databases such as Oracle and IBM DB2. In Snowflake, as in most databases, managing transactions consumes resources. If you are performing multiple transactions on the single database, operation from any transaction should not interfere with operation in other transactions.
