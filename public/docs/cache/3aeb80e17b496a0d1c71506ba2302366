</html>";s:4:"text";s:6906:"<br>After talking with her on the phone, Darin became worried and came home to comfort her. The subsequent trial went on for less than a year before the judge pronounced her sentence. NO. <br> <br>But a few days later, when I confronted him with affidavits given to me by Darlie’s stepfather and Reyna, he confessed that he had, in fact, talked to Kee about faking a burglary. “They just stabbed me and my children!”. I feel like the husband must know more. Darlie Lynn Peck Routier was born on January 4, 1970, in Altoona, Pennsylvania to parents Larry Peck and Darlie Kee. “At the time, we were in the top two percent of the tax bracket for our age,” he told me more than once. None of those 200 possible matches belong to Darlie. There was no intruder in that house only Darlie and Darin and no way in hell she attacked herself or those boys is such a brutal way. There is just too much that doesn’t make sense. <br> <br>Post was not sent - check your email addresses! Parks’ replacement, Doug Mulder, curiously chose not to pursue Darin. A few hours later, a 911 dispatcher in Rowlett received a frantic call. Her affectation reminds me a lot of Diane Downs. But according to the affidavit given to me by Darlie’s stepfather, Bob Kee, Darin said in the spring of 1996 that he had a plan in which he and his family would be gone from the house and that a “burglar,” hired by him, would pull up with a U-Haul truck, remove household items, and keep them hidden until the insurance company paid the claim. According to Wertheim, Darlie’s right ring finger was neither identified as a source of the print nor excluded. <br> <br>Registered nurse on duty the morning of June 6th. A horrific incident took place on the night of June 6, 1996, and when the police arrived at the scene, they found one boy dead, another dying, and Routier herself with serious but superficial injuries. Tom Bevel informed the court that the cast-off blood on the back of her nightshirt suggested that she had drawn her hand back every time before stabbing the children repeatedly. What was the motive? I really believe that Darline is innocent and always have. <br> <br>If Darlie had planted the sock, how did she avoid leaving a trail of her own? decided to hire Mr. Mulder, and he became my daughter's lawyer on October 21, <br> <br>We report on vital issues from politics to education and are the indispensable authority on the Texas scene, covering everything from music to cultural events with insightful recommendations. They study her the same way the crowds at the Louvre stare through a sheet of bulletproof glass into the enigmatic eyes of the Mona Lisa. Has handled Darlie’s appeals process. But they could find none of Darlie’s blood—or anyone else’s blood—outside the house. <br> <br>As the hearing ended, one of the more curious judges motioned to me and asked me to point out Darlie’s mother, Darlie Kee, who had made headlines of her own for her passionate attacks on an assistant district attorney, and Darlie’s husband, Darin, a headstrong machinist’s son who, after the trial, had likenesses of his wife and their three boys tattooed on his right arm. Wills Point, Texas. <br> <br>Darlie, flamboyant as always, wore a silky belly-dancing outfit. She cooked for neighbors going through hard times and even made a mortgage payment for a neighbor with cancer. Apply the wisdom of Solomon.  <br>However, the physicians who treated her at Baylor University Medical Center stated previously to the police officers that the wounds could have been self-inflicted. She also said he dropped the knife yet there was no imprint or blood spatter when she “claimed” he dropped it. People can’t wrap their heads around hhe fact that a mother could kill her own children. If Darlie, as the cops and the prosecutors believed, had become increasingly upset about money, why didn’t she murder Darin and cash in his $800,000 life insurance policy? I’d imagine the would to Darlie’s neck would have caused internal bleeding that also drained in to her arm. Her mother, Darlie Kee, also knows she’s guilty that’s why she won’t get the money for further DNA testing. I just can not wrap my head around that! Provided an affidavit for Darlie’s defense stating that his colleague, Dr. Kenneth Dekleva, indicated to him that he had served as a psychiatric consultant on Darlie’s case. Testified at trial during the punishment phase. He compared bloody fingerprint 85-J against those available for Damon and Devon. Sorry not following. Good morning, Alice! She wonders what Damon and Devon would look like if they were still alive. No dna from intruder. Geeze. This site seeks to provide information about the case of Darlie Routier. Darlie Lynn Peck Routier was born on January 4, 1970, in Altoona, Pennsylvania to parents Larry Peck and Darlie Kee. Assistant District Attorney Deputy Chief, Appellate Division. But if she was smart enough to plant fake evidence, wouldn’t she have been ready with a more believable story about what the intruder looked like and how the killings occurred? <br> <br>God bless you. Also, they were given DNA results 2 months ago yet they are not shouting from the rooftops that it clears her. Even on the death row show 12 years later she doesn’t speak of what happened with much emotion, which I think is very telling. The stories you want, in one weekly newsletter. His girlfriend was found dead in Lake Ray Hubbard close to where Darin kept his boat. <br> <br>Darlie told me she was never serious about divorcing Darin. <br> He has since remarried. CLICK & JOIN US MONDAY @10 PM EASTERN ON WEBSLEUTHS LIVE. Killed savagely 2 kids but left the adult to ID him alive? It just doesn’t happen that way. It was a last minute effort to fool the public. The youngest of Darlie and Darin’s three sons. There was just one problem. After moving to the Dallas area, he started a small company that tested electronic components, and when he began making money in the early nineties, he and Darlie cut loose. Routier and her family hired J. Stephen Cooper as her post-conviction attorney. He provided an affidavit to the defense in 2003. I’ve studied this case for 17 years. Even the most experienced legal hands have found themselves sucked in by the Routier saga. The cops’ suspicions grew when the doctors and nurses who treated Darlie told them that her wounds could have been self-inflicted. If Darin's fake burglary scheme had come out before Darlie's trial, her lawyers surely would have used it to create reasonable doubt, perhaps leading to her acquittal. Almost done with her federal appeals. Testified at trial as to Darlie’s demeanor on those days. Her cuts were NOT deep and the doctors remarked on the hesitation wounds. AND SWORN to before me on this the 12 day of July, 2002. and fully competent to make this affidavit. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:10:"darlie kee";s:5:"links";s:3612:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/signs-of-a-loner-86e6ec'>Signs Of A Loner</a>,
