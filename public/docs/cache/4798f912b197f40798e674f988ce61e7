You don’t want to leave that game and think about what if or what I could have done. He saved me. Working out with my grandpa and being around him and stuff like that -- he’s dealing with a lot right now and it’s hard to be away from him but I’m glad I could get a win for him and hopefully he’s proud.”, On the defense getting better after losing Al Horford and Aron Baynes, “Losing those two guys was definitely a big hit to our defense and our team but it just allowed other people like Jayson and Jaylen, Theis, and Rob Williams to step in and really pick up the slack on their end and that’s tremendous for us because not only do you have Jayson and Jaylen playing offense, but you have both playing defense and becoming two-way players. When he’s playing well, they are a different team so that was a challenge that I took on and it was a team and group effort. Guys like that deserve to play on these stages and for all the marbles. And (going) even to the second round of the playoffs is really hard, that means you have to win a playoff series. </p> <p>The report found one other missed call, which, again, went against Boston. We should definitely have a lot more in our toolbox to go back to. Y’all got it.”, “It is is what it is. </p> <p>After the game, Brad Stevens, Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and Jayson Tatum all spoke. Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our    User Agreement,  Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement,  and Your California Privacy Rights  (each updated 1/1/20). I talked to those guys last night. Celtics fans have anxiously awaited the league's verdict on the matters, and on Thursday, it released the Last 2 Minute Report on the game's ending. Tough group, resilient group. No foul was called, though, and the Raptors survived to win in double overtime. Just a bad offensive night for me, terrible offensive night for me.". They got all those intangibles. They keep you on your toes the whole time, he’s a heck of a coach, they’ve goty really smart players. Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse, left, and Boston Celtics' Daniel Theis (27) react during the second half of an NBA conference semifinal playoff basketball game Friday, Sept. 11, 2020, in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)AP. Coach Nurse's (TOR) presence in the corner is not illegal and he does not directly interfere with the play." </p> <p>And he told me he was going to be a little better from last game to this game, and he did. They made me keep my head high. I couldn’t feel anything. "Anunoby (TOR) makes contact to Walker's (BOS) arm during his shooting motion that affects his driving shot attempt," the report states. Special kid, you know? All I can say is I’m grateful, man. © 2004-2020 CBS Interactive. The big shot at the start of the fourth, a couple of pull-ups. I thought the two plays of the night were Smart’s block and Tatum’s rebound. And so, like, they are young by every metric except playoff  experience. Enjoy this, enjoy this win and be ready in a few days.”, On the pass to Grant Williams that resulted in Williams being fouled, “I ain’t gonna lie, that was a lucky play. ET on Friday, August 6. But we’ve got some good fans, and some of our fans are pretty damn accomplished basketball players who are the best, the best, the best. </p> <p>He was unbelievable.”, “That block was, heh, that block was so special it was unreal. I knew I was going to draw a lot of defenders. That is especially true in the postseason, when officials have a tendency to hold whistles and let players play. Walker made just one his six attempts from behind the arc for the third straight game to extend his outside shooting woes. ", How Walker's 5-point Game 6 stat line made NBA history. It’s big time, a special feeling for me.”, “It feels good man, it feels good to be able to play meaningful basketball. I’d say we saw more defenses and more stuff and more ... right when something worked, the next play it didn’t work anymore. That was a hard-fought game right there. We have a good group of guys and we love playing basketball with each other and we love making each other better. </p> <p>We played a great Raptors team. He told me just shoot it. For him to come in in a game like that, Game 7, a rookie to come up with that play, even though he missed those free throws, the fact that he was in the mix to come up with that rebound was incredible. I knew they were rising superstars. I thought I was going to come up with the block and I did.”, “Oh man, Grant Williams. Still, Walker is confident he'll rebound in Friday night's Game 7 -- just the second Game 7 of his postseason career after a 33-point Hornets loss to Miami four years ago. He’s on a different level at that end of the basketball court.”, “Oh man, it was a huge relief. Shake it off, circle back tomorrow, get ready for Miami.”, “It started hurting and to be honest, adrenaline took over. He shows it night in and night out. That’s what this game is about.     6-keys: media/spln/nba/reg/free/stories, at He deserves to experience this. </p> <p>He’s not even a rookie anymore the way he plays, the way he sees the game, the way he comes in, he brings the energy. All they’ve done is played in now it’ll be three Eastern Conference finals for Jaylen, and two for Jayson, and they’ve been in this stage and they’ve been huge parts of it. You don’t take it for granted and this is special; there’s only four teams left. I’m just thankful.”, On his team and its chances against Miami, “This is a great group. For U.S. viewers, the Celtics vs Raptors live stream will be broadcast on TNT. </p> <p>Me and Jaylen spoke last night, and he was a little bit disappointed in himself. Boston Celtics vs. Miami Heat: Eastern Conference finals will begin on Tuesday, Celtics get surprise video messages from family to inspire them before Game 7 vs. Toronto Raptors, Next NBA season won’t begin before Christmas, NBA draft pushed to mid-November (report). We didn’t come down here just for the first second around. That’s what a team is for. So like I said, we’re going to celebrate a little tonight. It’s a special group we have, and we fought, we clawed. We’ve learned so much from each other and we have grown so much. We’re like basically a college team with a couple of guys... You know, it’s funny, I talk all the time about, you’re only scrutinized if you’re in the arena and Jaylen and Jayson are just like, this is all they’ve done. We just got to get out there and do it.”. He got a couple loose balls, he almost came up with another couple rebounds there toward the end of the game. So we’re lucky to move on against a really special Toronto team and organization. We bring sports news that matters to your inbox, to help you stay informed and get a winning edge. That’s a credit to Siakam. All Rights Reserved. I told (Jayson Tatum) it’s an honor to be able to play with him and grow. </p> <p>Though knocked down 4 of 7 3-pointers in the C's Game 3 loss, those four makes equaled his output from Games 2, 4, 5, and 6, when he made only 4 of his 26 three-point attempts. I think when you’re trying to achieve something, especially winning a championship, you’re going to have to go through some things – some heartbreaks, some tough moments, a lot of adversity – and just see how you respond. And they held me down. Feel a lot better when you win. Even though we lost two key guys on the defensive end, everybody else picked up the slack for them and picked it up for our team.”, On his game-saving blocked shot, and enjoying the battle with Toronto, “I loved it. </p> <p>For all we know, Boston could have benefited from a number of missed calls earlier in the game that merely got lost in the shuffle. I hate those cameras in the locker rooms. We have to get ready for a different, more unique team now in Miami.”, On Marcus Smart’s blocked shot on Norman Powell, “Yep. The NBA's Last 2 Minute Report says two crucial calls were missed in last night's 2OT thriller between the Celtics and Raptors, both against Boston.The first missed call was that OG Anunoby fouled Kemba Walker on the arm on this potential game-winning shot attempt. They love to play, they love to compete, they love to win, and I love to be a part of it.”, “Like I said earlier, I have to tip my hat off to Toronto. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:42:"is kemba walker playing tonight vs raptors";s:5:"links";s:7094:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/is-demonoid-still-active-86e6ec'>Is Demonoid Still Active</a>,
