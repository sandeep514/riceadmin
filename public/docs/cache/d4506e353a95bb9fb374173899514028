Overall decent way to waste 90 mins on Netflix. It's just a plot device to introduce the shadow people (another thing a lot of people actually see out of the corner of their eyes) as the main villain's underlings, the Hat Man, who's just another shadow person who, you guessed it, wears a hat. Be Afraid is a very Stine/King esc. Fandango helps you go back to the movies with confidence and peace of mind. Movies. So do his kids. Muskaan's childhood friend, Ujaala (Anjala Zhaveri), has been carrying a torch for the brooding Vishal since childhood, but he won't give her the time of day. It's some incredible feat how many films Be Afraid tries to be; it's still setting up characters and plot threads over an hour in. <br>                      Every Horror Film Made from 1895 - present, The Chronological History of the Cinematic Macabre, Underappreciated (or Unknown) Excellent Horror Films, Unmade Films That Would've Been Interesting To See. Review by HeavenSentbutHellRaised87   ★★★. Makes a few half hints at various sub horror genres without committing to any, resulting in a confused trail of vague narratives and undeveloped back stories, that leaves you wondering, briefly, wtf was that all about, but ultimately not really caring.                                <br> <br>                      I literally remember nothing that happened in this whole movie other than it sucked.

A couple shots look pretty…, If you've payed any kind of attention to what I usually log, you'd notice that a lot of it is shitty B-horror flicks, and that's because I really enjoy watching some dumb fun, plus I'm a sucker for horror films. Still, I found it entertaining enough. However, the film throws so much at you and does so little with it that these scenes get bogged down a lot. With the destruction that comes with a category 5 hurricane also comes months of rebuilding and recuperation.

But what I liked actually comes after that sacrifice and that is when John returns home and he believes he'll be reunited with his family. [Be Afraid] does not frighten, mobilize nor entertain. Montaggio a cura di Julie Beziau. For a movie with so much going on, it's surprising how boring this is for the first hour. This isn't as bad as The Gallows, which is most likely….

I'm still hopeful it veers away, leaves Florida alone and just plain fucks off. The story is more complex than it at first appears, but it is built of fairly familiar building blocks.                      I do think the movie gets a little better on that front, in that, while not necessarily the most likable group (particularly Heather, who for a lot of the film, comes across as incredibly smothering and unfriendly), you somehow buy into their plight.

The shadow creatures look kinda like some sort of toxic waste zombies to me. They can be inventive, imaginative and do things most mainstream horrors are afraid to do. [U]ltimately it felt like a TV movie, and I really wanted more than that. Technically it's fine, nothing is wrong yet nothing is trying to be special. <br> <br>The movie is about a doctor and his family who have moved to a small country town that has been facing strange occurances that only a select few are willing to discuss.

Since I mentioned the main stars I’ll start the review off with them, this film is probably Brian Krause’s best performace from him that I’ve seen yet(granted he’s in a lot of very bad movies), it was a pretty powerful and very likeable father role performance.                      There are sprinklings of good character moments throughout, such as a particularly effective scene explaining a miscarriage to a child which holds a lot of emotional weight.

Dr. John Chambers Jaimi Paige.                      Extra half star for little screentime of the kid and the kid not being annoying. I don't really wanna go over the story too much, I'm honestly not that much in the mood, but my favorite part of the movie would definitely have to be the third act.     |                         Continued from the previous episode, Ben is running from Zs'Skayr and Dr. Viktor. This film really wants to be a drama, but it's too ashamed to admit to itself that it wants to be one that it chucks in pointless scares to have it be classified as one. And also, it's a little pet peeve of mine when the movie poster has one very distinct and vibrant color on it but that color isn't really used at all within the movie.     |                         Con Janet Montgomery, Shane West, … I've never (fortunately) suffered from sleep paralysis, but my mother has and it sounds like it's just the worst.

It doesn't add much to the movie, I'm still giving this 2 stars, but I liked it regardless. You're really given no reason or explanation as to how the Hat Man turns this sacrifice into his own shadow person, but given everything you know about the movie, I do think it fits. Then there are those like Be Afraid. It wasn't good. 					TMDb                      These encounters begin to haunt John, transforming to complete terror as he discovers the entities' sole purpose... the abduction of his seven year old son. The old “My phone died, can i check facebook?” ruse is used by a girl in a police station to covertly access their highly confidential investigation reports .

Be Afraid is a film that tries to be smarter than your average dumb horror movie, which is why it's one of the worst ones I've ever watched. <br> <br>There is all this build up about this tunnel out in the woods and when our main character final gets there we're presented with 5 mins of him walking through a bunch of fog and a shaky cam confrontation.                         | Rating: 5/10 Meanwhile, in outer space, Grandpa Max tries to bring the shuttle to Earth while Zs'Skayr and Viktor search for Ben.
