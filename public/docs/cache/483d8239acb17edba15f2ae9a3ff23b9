Getting it can be tricky, so just follow these guidelines — it’s mostly about treating Bullet with kindness at every opportunity. Do not destroy any of the totems you find throughout the game. In the last confrontation with Carver, the main character will be killed by him. If you have trouble navigating the darkness, remember that you can use night vision mode on your camcorder to see better without the threat of monsters tracking you. Given the commands available to the player regarding Bullet, be sure to use the loving options whenever possible. The Blair Witch game builds on the reputation of the original first film. There are a series of endings you can unlock, and some of them are a lot trickier to get than others — for one, you’ll have to complete the game, then take an item with you into NG+ to complete a puzzle.

He was the “picked last for kickball” type in the army, and after his return to the States, his life didn’t get any easier. After fending off the monsters in the forest and killing the Sheriff in the Witch’s house, Ellis will take Carver’s life, along with his face. NOW! While we can argue that dying is Ellis’ only freedom, it sure does make his trails and attempts at doing good feel like they are all for nothing.
