Just as it looked as if the Pacers and Wilcox were ready to part ways, Indiana came to him with an offer he couldn’t refuse. Even with the likelihood that Durant misses most – if not all – of next season, Brooklyn figures to be in the hunt for a top seed.

He has a great attitude. That Summer League showing helped earn Reed the rest of his ’18/19 guarantee and secure his roster spot temporarily, but he was Phoenix’s final cut this week when the club signed Jamal Crawford. This is definitely something the Pleasant Grove, Utah native will be looking forward to, and undoubtedly be preparing for throughout the year. As such, a claim is not expected. Contact him via email at rgeneral@gannett.com. The Nets enjoyed their most successful free agent period ever this week, agreeing to deals with Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and DeAndre Jordan.Â The moves figure to make Brooklyn one of the Eastern Conference’s premier teams next season, one year after the Nets’ made the postseason. Instead, he’ll head back home to Salt Lake City with his wife and three-month-old son to spend some time with family before returning to Indianapolis in hopes of being 100 percent by the Pacers training camp in September. 10/16/19 — Waived Walter Lemon Jr., CJ Wilcox and Amida Brimah. “He decided to try and fight through the pain to help the team. The fact that they were going to do that also gave me the motivation to try to prove the statistics wrong and get back out here and show that I can still be an NBA-level player.”. Still working on his timing and confidence coming off the injury, he won’t be traveling with the team to Las Vegas. Wilcox to a two-way contract. C.J. Wilcox … âThe thing about the NBA, everything you read is plausible,â Dinwiddie said to The Athletic’s Michael Scotto. A change in scenery may work in the favor of Wilcox, and an opportunity to make his mark in the association might be on the horizon. Wilcox to a two-way contract with the team. When the roster was announced last week, he wasn’t on the list. Just yesterday, basketball journalist David Pick tweeted Wilcox was reportedly drawing interest overseas interest for Baskonia Vitoria, but the former first-rounder will instead remain in the United States. Now, he's back. The Fort Wayne Mad Ants, Indiana’s G League affiliate, completed a trade with the Memphis Hustle earlier this week to obtain Johnson’s NBAGL rights, so the Pacers presumably view him as a player that will eventually end up in Fort Wayne. While there was some uncertainty about his place on the Suns’ roster heading into the summer due to his lost rookie season and the partial guarantee on his 2018/19 salary, Reed played well in five Summer League games in Las Vegas, posting 13.4 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 3.0 APG, and a .489 FG% in Vegas. For the first time, Dinwiddie addressed Brooklyn’s moves, giving a coy response to the nature of recruitment among NBA players today. [RELATED: Hoops Rumors Glossary: Two-Way Contracts]. Guard Edmond Sumner has agreed to a three-year contract to stay with the Pacers, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN tweets. The Indiana Pacers have confirmed the signing of 6-foot-5 guard C.J. The Pacers have removed three players from their roster, announcing today in a press release that they’ve waived Walt Lemon Jr., Amida Brimah, and C.J. Jul 11, 2014 - C.J. He signed a two-way contract with the Portland Trailblazers in 2017 only to be sidelined with season-ending arthroscopic knee surgery. With the spotlight now shining on the Nets, Dinwiddie noted that the team expects to be in contention for not just a playoff spot but for a title in the coming seasons. Assuming he finalizes his deal with the Pacers, who were intrigued by the Miami guard leading up to the 2017 draft, as Scott Agness of The Athletic tweets, Reed will join Edmond Sumner as the two-way players on Indiana’s roster. He has a $1.8MM cap hold, Bobby Marks of ESPN tweets, which is factored into the team’sÂ $5MM of remaining cap space. “I’m really excited with what he has to offer whenever he’s ready to go. He was drafted 28th overall by the L.A. Clippers in 2014, but his NBA career never really took off, spending the majority of his time in the G League. Reed, who was officially cut by Phoenix on Tuesday, will have a clear path to sign with Indiana as a free agent if he goes unclaimed today. Copyright © ClutchPoints. Current Net Spencer Dinwiddie, a crucial part of the franchise’s increased success as of late, reportedly played a major role in recruiting those aforementioned All-Stars. Indiana’s backcourt will be led by NBA All-Defensive First Team member Victor Oladipo, alongside starting point guard Darren Collison. Wilcox signed a multi-year contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. The Pacers issued a press release on Friday announcing their 18-man roster for training camp. He did have a respectable college career, averaging 18.3 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 2.5 assists per game in his senior year. “I wanted to be done.”. Wilcox to a two-way contract. He was waived by Memphis in June. Every time he reached a new achievement, Wilcox would say, “OK, what’s next?” When he was able to walk and start building up the strength to start running again in March, he made the decision that he wanted to come back to the NBA. Lemon and Brimah are on track to join the Fort Wayne Mad Ants, since the Pacers’ G League affiliate has acquired both players’ returning rights. Meanwhile, the Pacers’ press release also included some bad news, as the team announced that C.J. C.J. The 76ers are weighing their options, says Sarah Todd of Philly.com. “He literally cannot raise up his arms to shoot the basketball,” Brothers said of his client. “The first thing they said is, ‘Hey, we’ll help you rehab. OCTOBER 19: The Pacers have officially signed Reed and waived Wilcox, the club announced today in a press release. Cory Joseph will be the primary backup point guard, while former UCLA standout and 23rd overall pick of this year’s draft, Aaron Holiday, should also be given some backcourt minutes off the bench. So, he spent months in the St. Vincent Center going through rehabilitation. The third year will be a team option, Scott Agness of The Athletic tweets. The 6’9″ forward has been solid in the G League, recording 15.9 PPG and 6.6 RPG with a .450/.401/.703 shooting line in 143 career NBAGL contests. Neither Pablo Prigioni nor C.J. Considering how cautious the Sixers have been in recent years with injuries, it’s somewhat surprising that Fultz is playing at all for the team to start the season. He wants to be back by training camp. In October, he was waived and Indiana signed Davon Reed. He met every mark that the training staff set for him, which kept him motivated to keep going. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the former first-round draft pick out of Washington will be joining his third NBA team. But when the team’s official training camp roster was announced, Wilcox wasn’t on the list, ruled out for 2018-19 with season-ending surgery. Portland will hope that Wilcox, entering his fourth professional season, can rediscover his once productive form as he resumes his career domestically. âAnytime you add two probably top-10 players in the world, multi-time All-Stars, youâre obviously going to get better,â Dinwiddie said. C.J. I told him last year when he was supposed to be our two-way, ‘I got a whole package of catch and shoot 3’s. He spent the entire 2017/18 campaign on that two-way contract with Portland, recovering from a right knee injury for the first part of the season. Wilcox, Eastern Notes: Dinwiddie, Knicks, Olynyk, Mykhailiuk, Robby General of the Indianapolis Star writes, Pacers Agree To Deal With Sumner; Sign Bowen, Gant, Wilcox, Pacers Sign Davon Reed To Two-Way Deal, Cut C.J. As the Pacers rookie/free agent camp roster prepare the week leading up to Summer League games in Las Vegas this week, Wilcox is still training at the St. Vincent Center. Follow IndyStar sports reporter Robby General on @rgeneraljr. Although Reed was on a minimum salary, he had a four-year contract and wasn’t signed using the minimum salary exception, meaning a team would need cap room or a trade exception in order to claim him off waivers.
