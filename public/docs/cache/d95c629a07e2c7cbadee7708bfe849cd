</html>";s:4:"text";s:11042:"First things first, before any case is made for Stephen Curry, we should review just what good defense is. Nobody else has more than. Curry’s defensive rating of 118.7 in Game 2 (measuring points allowed per 100 possessions), while not good, actually was the best among Warriors starters. Pronunciation: \STEFF-in\ Wardell Stephen Curry II Twitter: StephenCurry30 (Steph, Baby-Faced Assassin, Chef Curry, The Human Torch, Threezus) Position: Point Guard Shoots: Right 6-3, 185lb (190cm, 83kg) Team: Golden State Warriors. Let’s make it clear as well that this article is not an attempt to prove that Stephen Curry is transcendent or game-changing on the defensive side of the floor. For the analytics lovers out there, here are Curry’s rankings in two key categories over the last three years. We can pick each of these apart, if you wish. The other one is treated as if he “melted down” and “didn’t show up” in the 2015 Finals, despite having equal (or better) numbers and still tasting victory. He’s the only Golden State starter shorter than 6-foot-6, and the least accomplished defensively alongside Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant. Adams still pointed to the injury, and 5½-week absence, as a factor in Curry’s struggles against Harden and Co. “I think when you miss as much time as he’s missed, it hurts you offensively and also defensively,” Adams said. “He never misses a day. Steph’s biggest strength on the defensive end, is his activity on and off of the ball. Curry, at almost 31, is a better and wiser version of the sharpshooter he was in 2016, which was arguably the greatest offensive regular season ever. In fact, it was a lot quicker than anticipated. Collecting steals and blocks are good but aren’t the only way a good defender affects the game. … That’s how the game is going to be played, and we have to adapt a little bit better.”, Ron Kroichick is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. ( Brett Coomer / Houston Chronicle ). His statistical feats over the last few years cannot be denied. Defensively it’s much more spontaneous, so I really think he’s catching up in that regard.”. pic.twitter.com/6U574zNhEw. There is literally no evidence that suggests Golden State wouldn’t have figured it out with Irving healthy, eventually started Iguodala, and caused the same outcome. However, in this specific situation and playstyle the Warriors operate within, Curry is the oil that keeps the machine going. But, it factors in a couple missed games at the end or any regression. He forces defenders to make more choices (often difficult ones) than any other ball-handler at the top of the key. It was a fraudulent ring, and he still didn’t even play well.”. When he’s on the court, they are scoring 117.9 points per 100 possessions (the league-leading team is Golden State at 114.6). And only half of it relates to the natural talent. Then, he’ll only be 82 from passing Miller for second and 495 from becoming the historical leader. It has for James in the last few years. What is important is technique and consistency.                    Rockets 127, Warriors 105, Sat. Curry is maintaining a 65.9 percent True Shooting mark on superstar-level usage (31.4 percent). Like many guards and wings in the NBA, he gambles sometimes on passing lane steals and poking at the ball resulting in silly foul calls and advantage situations for the offense. One-on-one defense on the ball is only a percentage of a player’s defensive skill. Next is team defense. Curry is about to be 31, but he’s fitting the mold that we’ve seen from most superstars in this generation: His prime is being extended beyond what’s expected. Though he does expect help from his teammates, the narrative that he is a poor one on one defender is false. First. Since 2016, he’s been able to witness the greatest shooter in history go through the pertinacious routines at practice and then execute carbon copies of those shots during games. The Rockets won 127-105. Two days later, he followed it up with a 48-point showcase in Dallas, drilling 11-of-19 triples. He also writes features on the Warriors during the NBA season, and on various other topics – ranging from the 49ers/NFL and major-league baseball to college football and basketball – the rest of the year. Lastly, A good defender is capable of defending multiple actions for an extended period. Their obvious plan to target him raises a familiar question: Is Curry a defensive liability? The closest thing to a perfect defensive player is still going to get torched by high-profile stars, especially in this era that includes a larger amount of space to guard, along with historic shooting and more versatile athletes. “I guess he has no problem winning a Finals MVP then. “When he applies himself this time of year, he’s always done an excellent job,” Adams said. Not true. In 2016, Kroichick and photographer Michael Macor earned "Best Sports Feature" from the California Newspaper Publishers Association, for their series on Antioch High running back Najee Harris, the nation’s No. So the Warriors expect more of the same Sunday in Game 3 at Oracle Arena. We saw it with Cleveland and Kyrie (Irving). However, since Curry’s return on Dec. 1, his usage rating is the highest on the team at 29.7 percent, with Durant trailing him at 28.0 percent. He gets his hands on passes and deflects the ball. Again, these are probably stingy estimates because Curry has shown the ability to shatter the 350 mark. Needless to say, this is the only reaction to some of these takes and rebuttals. Will 49ers’ Week 7 game be postponed due to Patriots’ COVID-19 case(s)? Stephen Curry (30) walks up the court after a play went against the Warriors in the second half as the Golden State Warriors played by the Houston Rockets in Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals at Toyota Center in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday, May 16, 2018. Now, let's get to the footage. He keeps his feet and hands moving...always ready. He led the Warriors with seven rebounds in Game 2, and he was their second-leading rebounder in Game 1 (with six). Kevin Durant will be the first to shut down any thought that shooting is strictly a natural born talent. “Right now, they’re going at him a lot and people are being kind of critical of his defense. Born: March 14, 1988 in Akron, Ohio us Stephen Curry. He guesses well on isolation moves and pull up jump shots, often forcing his opponent into a tough contested shot or leading them into a ready, help-side defender. The league is full of tough shot makers, especially at the guard spots. It is, once again, the highest individual offensive rating on the Warriors. With Curry in the lineup, the Warriors are 24–8, which translates to a 62-win pace. There is a reason a player such as Stephen Curry can be ranked 17th out of all point guards (at least 20 MPG) in Defensive RPM, yet be third overall in total RPM. Curry is absolutely the weak link when the Warriors are trying to close games because their lineups suggest it. He keeps his hands and feet constantly in motion, making it hard for clean passes to get through as well as making it difficult for the offensive player to find a specific movement to counter. “You control your movements a little better on offense, because you’re in charge of your body. “It’s a joy to see, and then to see the production (in games) and how he ties everything together. He gets the car moving, while Durant and Thompson are each high-powered nitrous switches that create the gap of separation. He’s exceeding 29 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game while shooting 54 percent from two, 45 percent from three, and 91 percent at the line. “I’ll be in situations where you have to make stops and take on that challenge,” he said Friday. But many of Curry’s skills translate to that end of the court — anticipation, quick hands, jumping into passing lanes and collecting steals. The odds are it won’t result in any more MVP hardware because of his supporting cast, but the offensive threat he imposes and unprecedented numbers should speak for themselves. The narrative on him is that he cannot guard players in a one on one setting. That’s the common thread.”. “Whether they get a bucket or not, my job is to make it tough on them. For every defensive possession he gets scored on after a pick-and-roll switch, there’s at least two or three where he stays directly in front of his man, moves his feet in the right direction at the proper time, uses his hands to disrupt a ball-handler, and gives a solid contest on a shot. At any rate, Curry refused to use his recent knee injury as an excuse, insisting he’s fine physically. Steph wouldn’t make it past the opening round.”. Two games into the series, his prediction seems prophetic. Steph Curry is getting picked on defensively, and that isn’t likely to change. That means Curry is 77 percent of the way to Allen’s record while playing (roughly) half as many games. It’s because a player’s offensive brilliance greatly contributes to winning and lifting a team to its ceiling. Active hands and feet are staples to good defense because keeping your body moving significantly decreases your reaction time… you don’t have to begin motion if you’re already in motion. A good defender realizes that there are 4 other players with him on the floor and that he has to make their jobs easier as well as use them to make his job easier. But it was appreciably worse than his 106.1 rating in Game 1 against the Rockets. In actuality, it’s a lot closer to 70–30 in favor of a player’s offensive skills and production. https://clutchpoints.com/top-16-point-guards-of-all-time-where-steph-curry-ranks At that point, he will only be 32 years old, turning the corner on 33. He hasn’t been caught ball-watching and falling asleep as many times as Harden during that span, but it’s not far off. So how quickly will he surpass his three-point idols? In 22 Finals games dating back to 2015, if you combine each series, Curry has averaged 25.4 points, 5.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists, and 4.0 turnovers. Can Jimmy Garoppolo save their season? pic.twitter.com/UJ6kW9vbQU. For perspective, anything eclipsing 60 percent True Shooting for a regular season is considered elite. Warriors guard Stephen Curry called it. Also worth noting: Curry’s defense was better in the West semifinals against New Orleans, when he didn’t have to worry about switching onto James Harden or Chris Paul. might change 44 school names, renouncing Washington, Lincoln and even Dianne Feinstein, S.F.
