David Seymour at Glenfield Mall. Those receiving employment insurance would be expected to report fortnightly on their preparedness to work and job application activity. In 2017, NZ First got 7.2 percent and nine MPs, the Greens 6.3 percent and eight MPs. He says each of the party's candidates bring a range of new skills and life experiences, and he's not worried about any surprises. David Seymour's used to being on his own in Parliament - it's a gag he wholeheartedly enjoys playing up to. It’s pretty much the opposite for someone running a small business. And there's strong representation from the firearms lobby, including its most recognisable name, Nicole McKee, who came to public prominence through the intense debate over new laws banning most semi-automatics and making it tougher to obtain, and keep, a firearm. That’s kinda sad. ACT has been virtually the only party standing up against the Government's "go hard, go fast" lockdown stance. It fails people trapped in long-term dependency. It is a strong argument, and only a tad disingenuous. Reader donations are critical to what we do. The same day ACT was wooing voters in Pukekohe and Robertson was addressing breakfasters in Auckland, small business spokespersons Stuart Nash (Labour) and Andrew Bayly (National) were fighting it out virtually at a Wellington Chamber of Commerce Zoom event. But ACT is the only one saying what the other 20 percent believe.". New Zealand's 12th public holiday, planned to start in 2022, leaves SME owners faced with another day with a wage bill but no revenue, or having to pay staff time-and-a-half to keep their businesses open. Bricklane Auckland, New Zealand 07:00 PM October 16. I tell them I've enjoyed my day – and I have. He and his wife own the Honest Lawyer pub and hotel in Nelson. When the ACT bus leaves for the walkabout at Manukau mall, I collar Chris Baillie. Once you get over 2 or 3 percent, you are no longer irrelevant and then momentum starts to kick in.”. He also outlined the BusinessStart package, a range of emergency measures for people who have lost their job due to Covid and want to start a business. Answering questions from small audiences. Still, around two thirds of people work for companies employing 20 staff or more. The ACT Party has been polling relatively well in the lead up to election day, with the latest results putting the party on 8 percent, meaning it would get 11 seats in Parliament. Based on the latest 1News Colmar Brunton poll, ACT could bag nine seats, with its party vote at 7 per cent. “Eventually, the leader’s brand becomes the party’s brand. That's OK, James McDowall tells me, it's all about getting your brand out there. Courting the small business vote is as hot a topic as any for this year's election. "It doesn't really worry me because I'm here as a team player, we've all got strengths and weaknesses.''. Alongside its employment insurance revamp, Act also proposed changes to mental health and addiction services in the country. From a one-man band to potentially bringing eight other MPs back to Parliament with him, ACT's David Seymour has been performing out of his skin. McKee says she never imagined herself as a politician but she's already had a taste of what public life can bring. "With New Zealand now officially in recession, having just had the largest quarterly fall in GDP on record of 12.2 percent, the recovery of small businesses is critical for New Zealand’s overall economic recovery," the spiel said. Tim Murphy walked along. Despite that she's less of a chance of getting into Parliament, but isn't bothered about her list spot. Or the Christchurch man who owns three coffee carts and a cafe. The party list has also diversified away from the traditional ACT candidate. ACT's Deputy Leader and Health Spokesperson Brooke van Velden proposes the establishment of an organisation called Mental Health and Addiction New Zealand (MHANZ). As New Zealand moves from crisis to recovery mode the need to support local industry has been brought into sharp relief. The 90-day trial wasn’t scrapped altogether by the Labour Government last year, just changed so it was available only for companies with less than 20 staff. Act is looking to revamp welfare in New Zealand. They stand up in turn, explain who they are, why they joined the party, what they believe in. ACT was pretty much written off at the 2017 election, receiving less than half a percent of the vote, an even worse performance than the 0.7 percent in 2014. Photo / Supplied. That could give ACT up to 11 seats in Parliament, including many of the hopefuls in Franklin. If this all goes the way the polls are suggesting, then one of my challenges over the next three years will be to actually develop a high-quality caucus culture.''. "Then there are financial costs. Several times a day. – Andrew Bayly. The candidates don’t appear daunted by the thinness of the crowd. We've got men and women; we've got one South Islander". “Business is a hard slog. She's no newcomer to ACT though, having helped campaign for the last five elections. "We will hear what both major parties policies will do to support small business to get through COVID-19 and recover.". ", Surprises in Act Party list announced by leader David Seymour, Brooke van Velden accidentally crashed an Act party - now she's their deputy leader, Act specifically singles out licensed firearm owners in its new pool of candidates, David Seymour to stand for Act in Whangārei - but not the David Seymour you may think, Economic Scorecard: The regions that rode into Covid crisis strongest, Act wants to slash MPs' air travel to combat climate change, How to stretch a tight marketing budget further, Christopher Niesche: The problem with Packer's pecker, Revealed: What makes the country's best employers, Fran O'Sullivan: How much Green will be in Labour's machine, Matthew Hooton: Triumphant Greens face difficult choice, Labour wins party vote in every South Island electorate, Burst bubble: Australian states scramble to trace more Kiwi arrivals, Spent $10m on the mansion? The dig at Andrew Little may be a bit harsh; the Justice Minister pushed to get support in place for SMEs struggling with rents, but the measures were blocked by NZ First. Since August 10, except when stopped by Covid-19 lockdown, Baillie and his colleagues have been out on the ACT bus, travelling the length of the country to deliver the party’s “Change your Future”  message. "[Act's employment insurance scheme] would remove the stigma associated with collecting a benefit for people out of work for a short time through no fault of their own," she said. That can matter a lot, particularly for companies struggling post the Covid lockdown, Baillie says. They employ nearly 600,000 people. “I wrote a column in the Herald saying ‘They are dead’. We've got two vegetarians. "MHANZ would not be a provider of services, but a world-class commissioning agency that assesses individual needs and contracts the best providers for a person's therapy and care. Both times the party was saved only by Epsom MP and leader David Seymour. 5,194 talking about this. "My worry is people will trade up to Christmas to get the Christmas bump, and then we will see a lot of businesses closing up in January and February," Bayly said. Bayly promised JobStart, an emergency programme giving a $10,000 cash payment to any business taking on a new permanent full time worker between November and the end of March. The ACT Party bus in Cardrona, Otago. I've buried too many of my friends, I've seen a lot of the language change in urban New Zealand that has slanted away from embracing rural New Zealand. ", The wage subsidy looked after staff, he says. Of course, it’s Baillie’s job to be tough on the Government. There’s a woman worried about “children being in charge at school”. Asked if there were any climate change deniers on the party list, Seymour refused to answer the question. The … What have you been hearing from SMEs as they move around the country? "I've received death threats and had the tyres slashed on my vehicle.". “Seymour is likeable and has avoided the controversial stuff, particularly around the Treaty.”. I leave the ACT bus at the Manukau shopping centre. “It was in effect a benefit.”. Rather than increasing tax rates to pay for the policy, Act proposes dedicating 0.55 per cent of income tax at current rates to a ring-fenced employment insurance fund. I get sick of being told businesses were looked after with the wage subsidy. "There's been a real erosion of where we feel we sit in New Zealand as a whole. Seymour now mounts the argument he's able to secure that seat under his own steam.

But he says that doesn't mean he's not serious, and the work he has done around charter schools and the End of Life Choice Bill are a testament to that. Seven of the top 10 ACT list candidates are small business owners, and the party is playing that card with potential voters. Number 9 on the party's list, Toni Severin, has one too. Still there’s some truth to what ACT is saying. ", "In addition to the cost of lockdowns, New Zealanders face the uncertainty generated by the threat of them. Photo Nikki Mandow. Glenfield Mall Auckland, New Zealand 09:30 AM See all events. Photo / Dean Purcell He made the comments at a virtual … The ACT bus tour is entering its last few days. “It’s letting individuals and businesses innovate. And I suspect they may be right: most of our other politicians just don't understand. "Our welfare system is due for a serious overhaul. "I've been doing this for 32 years. If we take one estimate from a major bank, a Level 3 lockdown in Auckland costs $440 million a week. Apparently it isn’t unusual to see ACT stalwarts Richard Prebble or Roger Douglas lurking at the back of the room when the bus is in their neck of the woods. They are probably used to it. It fails to address the realities of a modern economy.". He lives locally and has come along with his wife to chat to the newbies. The group are off to Karaka now, for a "relaxed discussion about politics and the 2020 campaign". But McKee isn't the only candidate with a firearms licence.
