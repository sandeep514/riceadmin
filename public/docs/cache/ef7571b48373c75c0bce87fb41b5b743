'src="//survey.g.doubleclick.net/survey?site=_m3ruhxl3ugwrvkpsf6ypa6xasq'+ Specifically, I thought that Curry was mixed race — half-black and half white. var rcds = document.getElementById("rcjsload_b42b6d"); As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. Most certainly, no insult (overtly or subtly) intended. (BUT do you have eyes? Quote: Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. I hope this article cleared up any questions about Curry’s race and that you have a deeper understanding of his background through the background of his parents and their lineage. This is why you don’t hear old black people talking about those happy days growing up, in the Jim crow era. With Steph Curry’s light skin and light brown/hazel eyes, it’s not a surprise that Curry’s race and nationality are being Googled often. Plus from  what I understand, Steph calls himself African American, I know his sister does for sure, That’s a pretty little girl, also bad as can be. First of all , from what I can see, I never commented on what Curry looked like, also I never said he wasn’t of mixed heritage  either. His sons are seen in the same way, although both have great first steps with the ball and can knock down shots from anywhere over half court. That’s what I meant by ‘disservice’. Or the skin from an African American for leather shoes and handbags. Now that being said,  Would please try to learn something. rcel.type = 'text/javascript'; Many people on this board have racial identity issues. @Fuzzybear they know the real truth the bad comments are just people who are jealous of black African diversity in the Americas or they want to feel whiter than they are. There’s no denying it. look at this guy he does look MIXED). I mean really?! Seriously! Post was not sent - check your email addresses! Researching Curry’s parents’ backgrounds gives you a glimpse of who Curry, and his siblings Seth and Sydel are and where they came from. Is the young actor part-Asian or multi-racial?

A disservice to people who up into 1960, almost hundred years after slavery officially ended, still had working slave plantations( with slaves on them). Your email address will not be published. Its a simple fact. The children each get pieces of their parents’ backgrounds and create a unique, individual person that also ties generations of history together into a new being. On the topic of skin color and toughness, several light-skinned players have had the same “soft” stigma placed on them because they weren’t “black enough.” Jordan Clarkson, formerly of the Los Angeles Lakers once recalled how Kobe Bryant used to tell him to stop “going to the hole like a light-skinned dude” and to “start doing it like a dark-skinned dude.” The topic of race is all over the place and these stories show that the NBA isn’t immune to it. Its a failure to all of mankind to do so and is worse than being of one race and raciest. I get it, your Europeans families all look the same, but that’s not how it is here. Where is the IKEA Brooklyn shuttle bus stop located? Next one form common in Cameroon is the condition known as Waardenberg Syndrome, However there are other forms of ocular albinism that just give you the eye color.

Curry talks about sneaking away from home games, when his father played for Toronto at the end of his career, to go shoot and run drills on the practice court with his brother and other players’ kids. Stephen’s paternal grandfather is named Wardell Curry (the son of Blanch Perline Curry). It’s just, maybe it’s a non-US thing but, I feel all these African-Americans are being done a disservice by being amounted to just ‘African American’ without explicit details of what is actually entailed in their mixed ethnicity. Is Tom Holland Gay? >rare disease where some africans could have blue eyes and grey hair. They look Western Asian. Does Panda Express have MSG in their food despite their claims? Especially the great-great-great Grand mother. How long does a background check takes to download? He is the son of Sonya Alicia (Adams), a volleyball player, and Dell Curry (Wardell Stephen Curry), a former NBA player. Even if you’re not an NBA fan, there’s no escaping Stephen Curry. @Bablah my black mom now has blue eyes now they turned from brown when she got to 70 years old. Stephen’s parents are both African-American. While Steph’s father gets most of the attention due to his NBA connection, Curry’s mother, Sonya, who grew up in Virginia, was a standout athlete in her own right.

My family reunion was like a rainbow coalition ,We have a huge range of color and traits. Tell this to a Puerto Rican, that it’s a disservice to just be called a Puerto Rican(without knowing their breakdown), or a Dominican, or any other mixed group, and watch the response.

African American is a cultural NAME. lol, he’s not mix it doesn’t take a too white or light of a parent to inherent their pigment. Africans have the same genes everybody else has. Let us know your thoughts below! She ended up parlaying her volleyball success into a scholarship to play at Virginia Tech. (function() { Required fields are marked *. Most of us take great pride in our African ancestry, which is why it’s the word ( African ) is included in our cultural name, but on the other hand that means AFRICAN AMERICANS are mostly part EUROPEAN or non african). To whom are you speaking of? })(); Ethnicity of Celebs | What Nationality Ancestry Race © 2020. Why do people act so uneducated and racist????? YES there are 100% Africans with greene eyes just google it. I honestly wasn’t aware Black Americans took pride in the ‘African-American’ descriptor. Period!!!
