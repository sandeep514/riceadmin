I agree...most gay men I know were turned or touched at his age...let this young men establish his own identity...as far as effeminate men go I know a few who are straight they were just raised in predominantly female households...they still be piping the hoes down... You didn’t know you liked boys until 14 or 15? ps...Congrats to Zion for coming out and living in HIS truth..... Shiiid he was enjoying some booty pirate action from ole Gabby so he see nothing wrong! Clearly this is a sensitive topic for you, but you’re reaching. It's a shame that he considers his son a mistake and a result of sin. There are photos that have been scrubbed from the Internet that seem to validate the rumors. Eleven......glad he's being supported by family but 11.... Sandra, I don't agree with you on much, but this post just struck me. His parents are trying to show him that they accept and love him and are proving it in their actions. I'm not gonna lie, I'm not familiar with the pride events, but I've seen pics and it doesn't seem like an appropriate venue for a child his age. School could have caused the above situation.Peer pressure is powerful.These kids see other kids kissing at school and think it's the norm,also admiration for it! I had no idea, she was the girl that had all the dudes trying to get at her. You can see it in his eyes. This all seems to be “the new gay, queer” look at me, I need attention for SOME, not all, but something is quite disingenuous about this new gay 2.0, “I’m coming out!”. Being free from that stress of trying to hide your feelings. Allow him to grow up and Express his feelings as he gets older. Mine is 9 and what he comes home with from  recess is scary. It’s the “acceptance” narrative that is being pushed in schools, and society as a whole. There is porn all over the internet and most children are smarter than their parents when it comes to viewing it. Maybe she was there in spirit and couldn't make the trip, but it would have been nice. But, if he truly is gay, it's good that he has support. I hope he wasn’t in there with R, Kelly?!?????????? Exactly. I knew he would be gay and now at 23 he gayer than ever. Gotcha back kid! Then the break baby came. They allowing this 11 year old to have a boyfriend? Of everyone. Published:  23:27 EDT, 21 December 2019   |  Updated:  17:37 EDT, 22 December 2019. So had dad had a janitor job that allowed him 2 b home everyday he would not b gay bcas as a basketball player he is always gone. Zaya Wade (born May 29, 2007) is an American who attends Sierra Canyon School in Chatsworth, Los Angeles. I was going to say Benjamin button as a baby .... but carry on .... https://media3.giphy.com/media/d3OG6pQJyk7v1i2Q/giphy.gif and IDGAF!!!!!

Just last month, the Wade family—and in particular, Dwyane Wade—received criticism after Zion walked the runway at his A Night on the Runwade event. Me included. The mom's hair wasn't combed and the daughter's hair had all sort of different colors and she had a really stank attitude. I have to say this is crazy... A sexual orientation comes about when you start having sex a 11 year old isn't gay straight or orther wise its a child why not say you think your gay fine son no issue but if you arent having sex just concentrate in being a child play with your friends video games kickball or whatever 11 year olds are doing worry about that when that part of your life begins. we need to see if we can fix that phone. When I was 11, I knew... in fact, I knew something was different when I was in kindergarten. Dwyane Wade's 11-year-old son Zion Wade officially came out as homosexual during Miami's Gay Pride celebration over the weekend. All those gay stylists that come to the home. In 2018, Major League Soccer player Collin Martin was the only active athlete in any of America’s five major male sports leagues after making his announcement on Twitter. If you never been with the same sex . That made my heart go pitter patter. I do not dislike homosexuals. In this case, a smiling Zion was joined by his stepmom, actress and advocate … Yall roll without me. And some of the real crazy ones are at these parades protesting. This kids are different. The two words don’t even go together. Stupidity is apart of this world we live in—so i get it. but like i said everyone is different. The faggotry in the Black community in America is disgusting. 99% of parents know their kid and know their child is gay long before they are told. In the early 80s not so much ? The Moniyhan Report came out during the 60's read it and make better decisions! Oprah Magazine participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites. Went back to that “son is gay” post to read the comments. The ones that don’t get it. Both sides of my family is full of freaks. You are the second gay person here who has confirmed this. Masculinity and gay are two distinct things. I just will never get that. I love that my oldest talks too me about about whatever he feels he needs to. The fact that Zion is coming out at 12 tells you he has been exposed to the lifestyle and probably groomed by someone older. Correct. The laws don't get thrown out the window at gay pride events. They won't let the kids grow up before making them define their sexuality because it's not about the kids. Im not down for him to get a pass bc he is gay. Happy your children can open up ? Im just saying. New to Kayo? Nowadays 2 girls is normal! Y'all didn't see that boy was gay?" I get that, but to actually come OUT as gay @ 11, that's my issue. ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE OFF LIMIT...NOT SELECTIVE CHILDREN DEPENDING ON WHO ARE THEIR PARENTS. He's a child, this is no place for him. Gabrielle also flaunted her phenomenal 5ft7in figure in a tangerine two-piece while chilling poolside with her 'miracle' daughter Kaavia James (pictured Saturday), 'Look at that walk!' The other son became real successful. I had Too Short BLASTING one day when he came in from work early. I can't remember anything from when i was 5 but people come out at all ages. I am not anti-gay, sweetie. lol,but whites are gay too.You sound crazy! Well, idk because I'm a freak now??? Wow you're a sucker. Pullleze I was bullied from the time before I went to grade school with gay slurs so save me the I didn't know what gay was until I was almost a teenager and I will be 47 next month. I'm still trying to get to grips with why and how kids are concerned with sexuality at such a young age? is the kid really gay or has he just been socialized gay. I knew way earlier that this I was different and lived in fear because I was so scared somebody would find out and then what. During a recent appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, NBA superstar Dwyane Wade recalled the pivotal moment his 12-year-old child, Zaya, opened up to him and wife Gabrielle Union about her gender identity.Wade used Zaya's deadname, Zion, while speaking to DeGeneres and explaining that she now uses the pronouns she/her. You’re different. Sandra is the most anti gay-gay person i know LOL. It's like Boom Bye Bye in a....rdue boy nah promote no batty man dem have fi... After my grandma passed in 2011 one of my mom's classmates came to visit her and 'her' name was Gerald and she was quite masculine. They were real though. and they sacrificed their children on the alter of Molech... Lgbt are WHITE ppl. you can't make my old azz understand it, LOL! This is something they should have sat on until he was 18. I've seen too many articles that don't support that. They were the same age as the kid up top at the time. Whatever you want to do on your own time. All that promoting will be for what. You can learn something from your kids,' Dwayne said on Showtime's All The Smoke podcast on Thursday. It's so beautiful', 'Nothing changes with my love': The former Miami Heat shooting guard - who retired from the NBA on April 10 - uses both male and female pronouns when discussing his 'courageous' child, 'My heart': Ever the supportive stepmother, Gabrielle attended the 11th annual Miami Beach Pride Parade in South Beach with Zion back in April, 'I've watched my son, from day one, become into who she now eventually has come into, you know what I'm saying? He should be focus on school and think about where he is headed when he gets older instead of kissing other boys. If I fail, if I succeed i take no issue with "kinds" Philly, but i just don't agree with children 'socializing' with adults in this manner (nothing to do with his 'orientation' ....but this seems like a very 'adult' enviornment for him to be in at his age). Men who have sex with men is still #1 for HIV transmission after 40 years. They grew older and faded in the distant....when did any of those mentioned take the nation by storm like they once did.....school daze, higher learning, do the right thing, jungle fever, training day, pulp fiction....those days are long gone and noone has stepped up to take their place....black panther maybe but even the moonlight marchallea guy got his academy award for being gay onscreen? No it hasn't. He may come out when hes 70 or never. But i would guess, to support him is to also educate and protect him. Folks been asking and commenting tho. Gotcha back, kid. That I know and understand. My best friends mom is a lesbian but never referred to her partner as her girlfriend . Whatever your preference, that's your business but it's not cool to allow children to be used as the face of this foolery. Most of the people who run these pray-the-gay-away camps are self-hating homosexuals themselves who take out their issues on the helpless teens who are left in their care. Now with that out of the way, please tell me what your comment has to do with what I said?
