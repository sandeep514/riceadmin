There’s lots of creepy imagery, elements of body-horror and more than a few throat-slits that are sure to leave you gulping nervously.

Little does she know, the villagers have been waiting for her because she got what they needed to lift off a plagueing curse. As mentioned already, Joko Anwar is the writer and director of Impetigore. The lone survivor of an enigmatic spaceship incident hasn't returned back home alone-hiding inside his body is a dangerous creature. After learning that the local bigwig, Ki Saptadi (Ario Bayu), is a practitioner of the ancient art of shadow puppetry, Maya and Dini decide to pose as students conducting research in order to find out about the house and the weirdness that seems to be affecting the town. It turns out her family’s domineering presence in the village is represented by more than just a large house & a fear-inciting name. “Impetigore” has only two stumbles that keep it from being a complete knockout and they both come towards the end. I very much wish Impetigore weren’t exceptional, that its handsomely executed but appropriately bleak grotesqueries were just another shock-of-the-day horror. By day she runs a clothing boutique with her BFF Dini. Join here. The first is an extended flashback sequence in which all of secrets are revealed just before the big climax—while I recognize the necessity for such a scene, it's dropped in with such a surprising lack of finesse that it winds up sticking out like a sore thumb, while at the same time slowing things down at just the moment when the tension should be at its absolute peak. But when neighbors throw a very strange party, nothing is as it seems in their picturesque neighborhood. And yes, it does happen that I find myself screaming, when watching a good horror movie. Impetigore is off to an absolutely amazing beginning which should be more than enough to get you hooked. In turn, it makes the pacing feel slow.     |                         We watched is when it was being screened at Fantasia Film Festival where it was loved by critics and audiences. The Indonesian ghost story Impetigore shocked me, chilled me, and left me guessing where its story was headed until its very last minute. He previously made the amazing horror movie Satan’s Slaves so our expectations for this new movie were huge. After the very intense opening scene, the real story begins and things only get creepier and weirder from that point. Just like with M. Night Shyamalan movies, Joko Anwar loves to include twists along the way. It also lingers in the form of a vicious curse that torments & disfigures each new generation of the community, so that whatever exploitative evils they committed in the past continue to haunt the present in an active, malicious cycle.

( Log Out /  A romantic getaway for two troubled college sweethearts turns into a struggle for survival when unexpected guests - and the surrounding environment - exhibit signs of a mysterious infection. Obviously, this means you end up searching for these twists ahead of time. I’ve not seen Anwar’s other film Satan’s Slaves yet, but I’m definitely going to check it out since I enjoyed this. As proof of Anwar’s versatility, Impetigore works more as a faster-paced, urban legend-based homage to 70s and 80s Indonesian cinema. Following a detour into superhero cinema with 2019’s “Gundala,” he has returned to horror with his latest effort, “Impetigore,” and right from the opening moments, it's clear that he's anything from a one-hit wonder. It starts with a concise, conceptually brilliant cold open in which a highway tollbooth employee is stalked and eventually hunted in her glass cuboid prison by a machete-wielding maniac. She realized that she might inherit a property from her rich family. Instead, it’s a minor miracle. Impetigore should be an industry norm. Whether both will be the same level as, or even better than (or maybe worse than, please don't!! That’s rare in a modern horror film, where each plot development is typically expected to hold some metaphorical Meaning in a 1:1 allegory. ( Log Out /  That’s an extremely rare quality to find in a modern horror film, especially one that sticks this close to the tones & conventions of its genre. She has a grudge and she was also born because of the sins of the orphans who formed her into the Queen of Black Magic. Maya returns to the village with Dini and unaware of the danger was waiting for her.

From "Veronica Mars" to Rebecca take a look back at the career of Armie Hammer on and off the screen. Also, he did one of the episodes of the HBO Asia horror anthology Folklore (read our review here), which was also a wonderful experience. 				Change ), You are commenting using your Google account. In order to find answers, she and her friend Dini travel to the Harjosari village where she once lived with her parents. ( Log Out /  Maya with her best friend, Dini, tries to survive in a city without a family. The opening scene begins with a lighthearted, self-aware conversation between Maya and a co-worker at the toll-booth. The premise, of a prodigal daughter returning to a cursed, secluded village to claim her supposed inheritance, has horror and mystery written all over it. Prior to watching this movie, we had watched his truly mindblowing horror movie Satan’s Slaves from 2017. Instead, it’s an international export that premiered to mildly positive reviews at this year’s Sundance before quietly finding its way to streaming on Shudder with little fanfare. Maya (Tara Basro) with her best friend, Dini (Marissa Anita), tries to survive in a city without a family. However, the rules & origins of its ghostly curse mutate & self-complicate often enough that it doesn’t feel lazily considered or over-simplified. For the movies by Joko Anwar, it’s often the story itself (along with the wonderful characters) that will draw you in immediately. Be the first to contribute! Thanks to Maya’s casually caustic pal Dini, comic relief remembers to prick bullfrogging tension every now and again 							 This FAQ is empty. “Impetigore” isn’t all about harrowing heartbeats and disturbingly gruesome sights. Much of it is, but not all. A same-sex couple move to a small town to enjoy a better quality of life and raise their daughter with strong social values. Impetigore screens online (Italy only) as part of Udine Far East Film Festival 2020, along with Gundala (Worldwide), which runs from 26 June to 4 July. When a truck pulls up, the car drives off but the driver soon returns and demonstrates that he knows a lot about Maya, delivering the ominous message “We don’t want what your family left behind” before attacking her. For the most part, most of the horrific imagery on display is reasonably restrained with an emphasis on the implied over the explicit, and when the gore does crop up, it exists for reasons other than to simply try to gross out the audience. The basic plot elements of “Impetigore” are perhaps not blazingly unique, I suppose, but what Anwar lacks in terms of originality, he more than makes up for with sheer style. Someone wants them dead, apparently with black magic that is very deadly. If you continue to use this site we will assume that you are happy with it. Impetigore (Joko Anwar, 2019) begins by introducing us to Maya. Unaware that people in her village has been plagued by a curse and she holds the answer to the curse.

From the studio (or producer) that brought you 2016's "The Wailing", though in my opinion not as great, "Impetigore" is an evidence that Joko Anwar (Jokan) is ever ready to take the global market with his horror, mind-twisting work of art (or at least just Asia, or maybe the south-eastern part of the continent). Synopsis The boredom quickly disappears with the arrival of a sedan that Maya is convinced has been following her around for the last few days. Instead, it’s a minor miracle. Maya returns to the village with Dini and unaware of the danger was waiting for her.

She realized that she might inherit a property from her rich family. And people assume horror lovers are the messed up ones. Following the electrifying opening sequence, he shifts gears to slow-burn mode, proving he is just as capable at ratcheting up the suspense via a more deliberate and measured approach—there's a beautifully done extended … In an ideal, perfectly-functioning movie industry, Impetigore would be the kind of well-funded horror flick that hits wide theatrical release regularly: handsomely staged, efficiently creepy beyond the traumatizing shock of its imagery, and complicated enough in its mythology that it’s not just a simple morality play. Rather than getting scared or intrigued, she gets happy that she has inherited an old and dilapidated house in a far off village.
