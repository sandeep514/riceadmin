"What? She grabs her bat, "I said get out." They continue until they fall back onto the bed. So I think to piggyback off of your last question, that is one of the reasons that she will still remain close to Jasmine is because she knows that Jasmine really cares about her and really has her best interests at heart.”. It felt like everyone was disappointed with him so why shouldn't she be?  	 She's about to stand up when Cesar blurts out, "I claimed you." "Oscar was trying to get at you when he saw the picture you sent me of you and your friends from camp. <br> <br>Monse screams. "Who said anything else is going to happen?" “I think Monse and Jasmine are so close because Jasmine accepts Monse for who she is and not what she wants her to be or not who she once was, which is one issue that I think she runs into with maybe some of the other core members of the group,” the actress said. Cesar puts his head in his hands and looks back up at Monse she's basically frozen. They got together at the beginning of the summer before their freshman year of high school and before Monse left for summer camp. Monse says. Cesar walks towards the window ready to leave when Monse springs to her feet and blocks him from the window. “It could be symbolic of a lot of things because Cesar’s gone through a lot. <br> <br>Monse gets to her room a minute too late.

How could he?" <br> <br>No one's going to want to date me after Spooky's little brother claimed me." “I’m very curious to see how she approaches situations now that she’s gone off and it’s two years later and no one is friends anymore. #onmyblock "Say anything and you're dead." The most shocking time jump reveal has to be Cesar. No one’s ever touched on that,” she admitted. <br> <br>Monse crosses her arms and looks back and forth between the boys. <br> <br>	Monse Finnie and Cesar Diaz  Monse asks. <br> <br>"Cesar told Spooky that you and Cesar smashed before you left for camp."

Cesar then surprises Monse at her house to apologize, but she threatens him with a baseball bat and confronts him before he has the chance. He falls back on the couch and lets out a huge breath. Monse says. Monse says. 	 <br> <br>Why'd you hug and kiss me during the whole movie? Monse whispers. Monse is … She's standing tall ready to face Cesar and tell him that she wants to be with him. Ruby says. 	 No matter what, these two always find their way back to each other. When Cesar turns around, he’s got a broken heart tattoo over his heart. <br> But what about Jasmine and Monse? "Nothing's up.  Hopefully, that doesn’t mean that it’s the end of the Core More, but we’ll see.”, She called the changes “a shockwave across the board because nobody expected us to drift so far apart from each other to end up doing so many different things because that’s how we all connected — through our environment and how we grew up and trials and tribulations and experiences that we had to go through. I claimed you and now you don't want to be with me? #monseandcesar “With Cesar, especially, I think she’s always so focused on trying to get him to see his potential and do better and be his inspiration. “I would like to maybe explore her dad’s side of the family.

I’m very interested to see what the future holds for everyone.”. “No matter how long you’ve known people, sometimes you do grow apart,” Sierra told HollywoodLife. Sierra admitted that she doesn’t think Monse would be too thrilled about Cesar’s transformation. Monse stands quickly and clenches her fists. now." <br> <br>Monse asks.
