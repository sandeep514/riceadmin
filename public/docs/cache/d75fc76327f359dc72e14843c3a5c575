</html>";s:4:"text";s:7793:"The property is owned by the powerful and highly influential Rothschild family. When he arrives, he discovers that the party is actually a secret sexual ritual, complete with Venetian masks and a whole bunch of naked people. Hollywood’s biggest “religion” is everything a creepy cult should be: secretive, convicted of international fraud, and seemingly fronted by Tom Cruise. As we mentioned earlier, the creepy/occult thing Eyes Wide Shut has going on means all sorts of conspiracy theorists are attracted to it. However, unlike The Shining or Barry Lyndon, Kubrick made very few changes to Anthony Burgess’ original book. A Clockwork Orange Is About MKUltra. Was Kubrick trying to out the secret society, or at least toy with their heads? The film Room 237 recently made waves by exposing a whole host of the crazy conspiracy theories focused around The Shining. Then there’s the frequent use of the word “bliss,” allegedly referring to Fort Bliss, where the experiments took place. But that's just me. After Alice reveals to Bill that she had a dream about having an affair with another man, Bill decides to explore his own sexual freedom. Before we go any further, we should point out that during the ’70s the expected date was 12/24/11—it was only later revised to 12/21/12. The go-to source for comic book and superhero movie fans. According to at least one conspiracy theory out there, The Shining is encoded with the predicted date of the Mayan apocalypse. But that doesn't change what an arduous production the film turned out to be. Julienne Davis is credit for playing Mandy, while Abigail Goode is listed as the Mysterious Woman. The 14-month film shoot forced delays on Cruise and Kidman's subsequent film projects, which included Mission: Impossible 2 and Practical Magic. ), The events of the film do show an elite cult-like ritual, and given Kubrick's detail-oriented filmmaking style, it's easy to see why people would read into the film. When Kubrick died in 1999, he’d only just finished editing his final film. The man behind films like the forever-analyzed  The Shining , 2001: A Space Odyssey, and A Clockwork Orange was a meticulous director â nothing showed up in his work "accidentally." We’ve already told you about the guys who think Kubrick faked the moon landings and hid clues in his film The Shining. Kubrick was never upfront about what his films were actually about, and that's probably so people would interpret and analyze them for years to come â which, naturally, they did. You know how the world occasionally seems to pick a celebrity to project all its insecurities and collective insanity onto? Aside from the film featuring a shady society of no-good rich types, there’s the fact that Kubrick himself had a personal interest in the cult—his daughter Vivian vanished into its clutches in 1998 and hasn’t spoken to her family since. Although the film is set in New York City, the entire film was shot on a sound-stage in England. The theory goes that while faking the moon-landings for NASA, Kubrick became aware of the fiendish, Saturn-worshipping sex cult at the heart of America’s space race. In one of many references to Kubrick's past films, the mask is taken from a direct mold of Ryan O'Neal's face from the 1975 film Barry Lyndon! To protect the nefarious leaders of these cults, Warner Bros quietly had the picture re-edited—and now denies this ever happened. Like many of his films, Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut has proven to be ahead of its time. All rights reserved. The masks were pattern after those worn in Carnival balls. And we all thought it was just a revolutionary blockbuster. Vivian didn’t abandon her family until Eyes Wide Shut was already underway, far too late for major rewrites. Our favorite is the theory that the entire film is a secret mockery of Woodrow Wilson for abandoning the gold standard. The authors even claim that Eyes Wide Shut was made deliberately boring in order to hypnotize us and make us accept these subliminal cues. Because of Kubrick's infamous perfectionism and fastidious attention to detail, Eyes Wide Shut took a staggering 400 days to complete filming.  To avoid an NC-17 rating, Warner Bros. posthumously superimposed digital figures in the orgy scene to obscure salacious activity. And that’s before we get to the use of American words in this British book/film, apparently referencing the involvement of the CIA. Yep: The slightly perplexing/disappointing film we saw at the cinema wasn’t Kubrick’s original cut. The most famous version has it that he used Eyes Wide Shut to rat on the Illuminati, who retaliated by having him killed on 7th March, 1999—666 days before 1st January, 2001—as a gruesome nod to his most famous film. The final cut of the film includes roughly one-minute of the footage shot. About halfway through the film a character sits down and explains to Peter Sellers that fluoridation of water is “the most monstrously conceived and dangerous communist plot we have ever had to face.” So when people claim that Kubrick intended the film as a warning against fluoridation they’re just stating the obvious, right? For as one character in the film says, âIf I told you their names I donât think youâd sleep so well.â. For a film ostensibly about aliens influencing mankind’s development, 2001: A Space Odyssey doesn’t actually have much in the way of space creatures. This is significant, because the theory hinges on the insane amount of references to the numbers 21 and 42 (12 and 24 backwards) in the film. We know the CIA’s MKUltra program conducted terrifying drug and mind control experiments in the ’60s and we know Anthony Burgess worked for British Intelligence. The hyper-60s LSD trip taken through the monolith at the end is really a metaphor for people being kidnapped by space aliens, taken from government files which were still top secret at the time. There you have it: final proof that the Shining is really a satire on economics. A sort of hyper-evil Illuminati crossed with whatever it is David Icke keeps going on about, they’ve infiltrated every organization on Earth to prepare us for the next stage in interstellar evolution—an evolution they intend to bring about by having sex with lots of children. A one-stop shop for all things video games. There’s even an analysis of how the cast share 21 double letters in their names, suggesting Kubrick was either so passionate about the apocalypse that he cast people based on the number of letters in their names, or that this theory is the pinnacle of OCD bunkum. For more, here are 10 things you never knew about Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut! So what are these clues? He avoids Facebook and Twitter like the plague. And he may have paid the ultimate price for this, because nearly every Kubrick conspiracy agrees on one thing—he was murdered. As such, Cruise and Kidman took actor Vincent D'Onofrio's advice, who told them to rent a house or apartment in the UK because of Kubrick's snail-pace.

Furthermore, every mask that appears onscreen during the orgy sequence was personally chosen by Kubrick, down to which specific actor would wear them, which position they were arranged in, and how long they'd appear onscreen. Or at least he would have, if occult New World Order types in league with Warner Bros hadn’t secretly re-edited it after his death. Released after his death, Eyes Wide Shut has gained a reputation as the “unfinished” Kurbrick film, despite its creator hanging on just long enough to oversee the final cut. Illuminati â including Beyonce and Jay-Z.
