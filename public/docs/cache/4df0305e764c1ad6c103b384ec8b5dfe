Knowing that it takes so long to diagnose and knowing that the sort of things that led up to it are the, the sort of symptoms that could mean it, I think you have to let people know. This is sometimes called limb-onset disease. And over Christmas, which was just after Christmas, I had to go to see the specialist, over Christmas. Do you know, we wouldn't have had them out here. There's currently no cure for motor neurone disease. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. So I wasn't as shattered as I might have been, I suppose, because I think I guessed that. I call them, I call, I find in the Internet somewhere, actually it was in the same hospital but a private company, they could do tomorrow, '1200, on same machine which normally they're doing for rest of them. In most cases, motor neurone disease is fatal because of the eventual involvement of the breathing muscles, which typically makes someone with the condition gradually more drowsy and more susceptible to chest infections. June, I was due back at neurology, so I didn't worry because my appointment was booked. But also on the Internet it said that a lot of people have the twitching and it doesn't mean they've got motor neurone disease. However, not all were referred to a neurologist so quickly. I left messages on the answerphone. And they say, 'So probably it's motor neurone disease.' However, not all were referred to a neurologist so quickly. They usually die peacefully in their sleep. If I walked for a reasonable period or length then my legs would start to go numb. In 10-15% of cases, motor neurone disease is associated with a type of dementia that can affect things such as personality and behaviour. Many people with motor neurone disease draw up an advance decision. It could be nothing, but if you've got the burning and you wanted to go on holiday and there's somewhere you wanted to go, go now.' Riluzole is thought to slow down the progressive damage to the motor neurone cells by reducing their sensitivity to the nerve transmitter glutamate. So I wouldn't blame anybody. Your respiratory or palliative care specialist can discuss the options available to you. Some cases of motor neurone disease may be caused by problems with the glia cells, which means that the motor neurones no longer receive the support and nutrition that they require to function normally. And well, he just more or less said, 'Some people do. Anyway we were, so now we were a year down the road and we still haven't got a diagnosis. And at the end of the rehabilitation I was no better, and I was just gradually getting worse. A few people were referred to a specialist in another area such as ear, nose and throat (ENT) or other specialties. Some people were admitted as an inpatient and had these tests within a couple of weeks. He thought it could be motor neurone. And we went there. And I told him. Not everyone with motor neurone disease will have speech problems, but there's a lot of help for people who do. But he sent me for another MRI of the spine. After an examination they started shooting questions at me and my response was to just deny everything! This is known as inherited or familial MND. So, and the initial reaction was that I would have eighteen months and then that would be it. MND is a rare condition and most GPs will only see one or two people with it in their careers, so they are likely to think first of other conditions or causes for the symptoms. I burst into tears after leaving her office; that was the emotional lability, I'm sure. This was kind of over Christmas and I said I was really worried and he said he would phone up a neurologist and ask him. This guideline covers assessing and managing motor neurone disease (MND). Rapid and accurate diagnosis, performed by a medical doctor experienced in MND care, usually a neurologist, is crucial in ensuring the needs of people living with MND are met from the earliest possible stage. I, I think, I think the way it was handled with me was poor. Many people diagnosed with the condition go through the classic stages of the grieving process, which are: If you've been diagnosed with motor neurone disease, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist may help combat feelings of depression and anxiety. I wait another three months because they sent the letter to the wrong address [laughs]. The original consultant in [city] said he had seen only once, and only peripheral involved, involvement on his part. And this went on for another, oh, eight months. He referred me to a neurologist and I waited from February until April 2000 for an appointment. Well, I couldn't. It's very, very hard. That was by then the Spring, and that led to a series of tests with the referral from the GP to [hospital] and a series of tests that were carried out there which were all the standard tests that would be associated with a nerve problem which had then been identified. I'd been waiting for MRI test here of the spine. Secondly, it affects each person in a different way; there is no definitive symptom which would immediately suggest the diagnosis. Yes. Except where otherwise stated, drug dosages and recommendations are for the non-pregnant adult who is not breastfeeding. John Westerby. This may make the motor neurones more vulnerable to damage and affect their function.
