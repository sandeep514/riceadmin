Lil Puss isn't a true mode; it's just there to prepare you for what the subject and map of the level is going to be like. Only now, I realise the legs are short? I've just never commented until today. I don't listen to kids telling me to do things either, so yeah. We're not really supposed to know what's going on until we explore, and I think the shadow ghosts in the cafÃ©teria were enough. Don't ruin the experience for yourself, please. Anyway, here you go. There's Something I have to show you what i made for you! Yes. I've come up with a hypothesis as to why: Doorframes are just holes in the walls that you can walk through. what is the music called when get chased by marzia v at the end? He is immune since he has made Doggos and Smile Wolf. Here's your worst nightmare! 20: See Discord. Hello again. Take your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat. It's like there's spoilers for content that isn't even included in the game yet, but whatever, we're learning. ― Marzia V. TheLanguage Levelis the second level ofAdvanced Education With Viktor Strobovski. Hello. -The alarm clock in the Language Level should be restored when the player has picked up a certain number of language notebooks (according to the mode). But the question is, does she have 4 human arms, or 2 human arms?  Anyway, we only have 7 left--wait, what? People really need to return to r/strobovski, by the way. Maybe it's also something else too? Though, it seemed like I had a lot of free time this time around. If Viktor likes memes, let him - this game is about him, after all, and it's not always about memes. See original post. You know, the one with Phonty. Anyway, since it's a day before a month before Christmas, I want to talk about something for a bit, but before we do that, I want to talk about the glitch again. I don't think I know what I'm doing.  If you want. Other than that, characters with jumpscares are okay. If you are referring to uh depression thing well I don't care, just Doggos is nice. well, the baldina and alex and viktor was made by me. Hm. The game for its mechanics of horror game is perfect but it has problem,here are my suggestions for improving the game while correcting these problems : It's good to add Easter Eggs but there are too many, as you can see all the popular youtubeurs make fun of Easters Eggs, that's why I propose two solutions: All monsters in the Easters Eggs in a level appear in the game because the more characters there are, the better it will be like the new Balid Basic. Look at them all. It feels as if all of my sprites are just big enough to fit all the details in. 	 Don't even know why. 1 Home 2 Behavior 3 Quotes 3.1 Basic 3.2 Songs His home is he sits on a lone table where big papers lay on. See his comments below. Usually I do, but I'm busy with other things in that time. It's strange. For the other difficulty, I would simply put easy, normal and difficult (of course write your way). Well, I also took advantage of multiple item spawns while trying to take these screenshots.ãåã¯ããæ­»ãã§ããã. If you undergo the last punishment, Laura's costume will suddenly become Mega Gardevoir (and Laura will have the original anger effects from AEWVS) and the Bad Ending screen will show Angell's stew on the table. (See the original post for more info.) I am a big fan of this game, and I would like to talk to you, mrdrnose. How can i join your discord, are you the dev too ? Strange, right? But see the hidden gallery that's pretty much just a hall of fanart along with various helpful items which the staff don't know how to get in. To see these paintings, it should be enough to unlock the extra mode, after finishing the game. For the other difficulties, I would simply have easy, normal and difficult (of course written your way); a bit like Outlast. 	In-Game What do you want to do? Stay tuned for more stupid summoning rituals! Rather than starting over and making unique sprites like MrDrNose did a few times, I just decided to go and do over the original sprites. Don't really know what to say but it's not all bad I guess. Later. But she's quite fast, which would be a bit problematic in some cases. See the test menu at the bottom of the screen. Your sanity now lowers when she jumpscares you, which recently was updated to alter your vision and control your actions at lower levels. -Make it so that Marzia doesn't pursue the player in Lil Puss Mode. 14: Granny already does that, but that doesn't really sound like a bad idea. Honestly I think it would be a very good idea as BBIEAL if you lose 3 times, the generator changes, and the game would be harder and cooler. Then I'll do the BBIEAL characters next. Also I kept the original costume just in case, though I think the recoloured one is a lot more fitting. Here's what it currently looks like. )So after that Marzia said something like Viktor, her behavior becomes the opposite and she can break doors. Yeah, well...I think I lied. I used to fear looking at myself in mirrors and reflective surfaces all around me. Also, mrdrnose has said on Discord that Baldi, Viktor and Marzia all had chase sequences, and he wants something different for Alice. Did You Unfixed My Game!!! If you can open the door, it'll be in one of the lockers at the front. And even though he's open to suggestions, the one thing you probably shouldn't do is try to convince him to change and add to the story and characters to your will. Oh maybe that's it. - The alarm in the language level should be used, when the player has picked up 6 language notebooks in normal, 8 in easy for more stress. Bye! I think it would be great if you added events too (3), but even more scary, like all the lights going out where we hear weird noises in the dark with another monster who stalks us, a tide of blood, phantom children who appear and murmur "you cannot escape", "give up", etc. Yep. I swear, you'd better forget. Like, literally 10 days. Good luck and I hope this game will have the glory it deserves. https://mrdrnose.itch.io/v-s/devlog/117338/aewvs-new-year-special. I'll just observe. Didn't check.  1 Description 2 Endings 2.1 Lil Puss Ending 2.2 Normal Ending 2.3 Linguistic Mathematics Ending 3 Soundtracks & Ambience 4 Gallery 5 Version History 6 See Also The Language Level is, by far, the largest level in the game. I just...don't really know what to do lol. I'm still willing to bet on the loneliness and isolation of Alice and Tiara though. Hey MrDrNose! So yeah! :D. So, we have...let's see. So anyway, I thought I may as well show you what exactly goes into all the sprites... (Don't worry, I'll probably do another one without the spoilers.). Are you referring to unique emojis, leaving only 20/70 "breathing" emoji left to be usable on the server? So I did. (also, that version contains a lot of expositions, spoilers and broken alpha content). The hidden buttons added in Version 0.1.3b are a bit mundane though. Sentences after the 2nd Language Notebook  : You can't escape Advanced Education with Viktor Strobovsky, You can't run but you can give me your legs, it's the parts i prefer, Granny makes a cake with the organs of her family, Before Marzia kills you, she eats Watermelons. (checks wiki) Oh yeah and Gregory. Also on every tenth language notebook she insults you (in every mode). Come have a look. (6). Hello again. 		 (Current). Now I feel uncomfortable being watched. book mark 268 days ago. Anyway, did you mean events? Yes, Alice does, in fact, have human hands. Still...having randomly generated rooms with various chances of improperly generated sections and flukes or bugs detracts from the true strategy of the game, as well as Angell's ability to go back and jump around in time. His home is he sits on a lone table where big papers lay on. By the way, there aren't any exact hints as to where it is, but if you find it, it's likely you'll also come across something for an alternate ending to the Math Level. Well...Try this link https://discord.gg/Ua3TDkx or go and ask AbsolLover666 or MrDrNose if that doesn't work. My first encounters usually make me jumpy and anxious to face them again, but now I'm just able to casually stare at Phonty and Natural Viktor head-on and walk backwards. I suppose if I just stop doing whatever other things I do, I can get quite a lot done. And with that, the AEWVS sprite character roster is almost complete! If you haven't noticed, pretty much the only assets original in later AEWVS are the Blender models he made by himself. Merry Christmas. I think I even might, just out of curiosity. Like, if you enter teleporting doors in the Math Level with a Rusty Fork, maybe you'd see something like that. In short events that would disadvantage us while frightening us. 	 	Lone Student Anyway, I wanted to do something for Christmas, and then it hit me: Let's draw the Christmas Curse characters! That's a bit more than I expected, but whatever, it's still quite a bit less than 15. That'll have enough time! You probably shouldn't advertise like that unless your content is AEWVS-related... Also, you're asking a favour, so he probably won't do it unless you're friends. See original post. He fixed it. Urgh. My idea is that we start the level normally, where a teacher presents the rules and everything goes well, except that the more we advance in the game, the more the teacher or we become weird (insult, threat), we see ghosts a bit like Albert who recommend that we escape as quickly as possible and the sets that change as and when. WAIT, NEVERMIND, I FORGOT AGAIN, SORRY -25/12/2019, 1) I make 2 episodes of your game check then out, then to the 2nd episode I will make a 3rd episode I was so close to beat it but I didn't and the 4th episode I finaly beat it 5th episode 666 ending and that's all for now, 2) I don't fucking know how to get the fucking "black door key" so HOW YOU SUPPOSE TO TAKE IT I HAVE LOOK EVERYWHERE I CAN'T FIND IT NO TUTORIALS HOW TO TAKE IT PLEASE TELL ME. I have nothing against the pussy mode, but I just had an illumination for its utillity in the game. Oh maybe that's it. I would also consider Granny's appearance one of them, too. (Ancient) Terry Tucker's Orange Clockwork: Phonty's default soundtrack. (16). 19: I know mrdrnose has various things he needs to work on in English rather than Russian, but Marzia is a Grammar Nazi - but instead in Soviet Russia. Guess we all get used to things. Whew, lets just wait for the reconstructon so that i can give my final thoughts about this masterpiece of a game! Just realised you probably all like the doggos because they're cuddly and puppy.
