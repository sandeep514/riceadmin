[31] His agent cited his differences with the organization as being "irreconcilable",[32] and Olajuwon publicly insulted owner Charlie Thomas and the team's front office. The 1989–90 season was a disappointment for the Rockets. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup. [13], After redshirting his freshman year in 1980–81 because he could not yet get clearance from the NCAA to play,[8] Olajuwon played sparingly as a redshirt freshman in 1981–82, and the Cougars were eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual NCAA champion, the North Carolina Tar Heels. Although the Rockets never set themselves apart during the regular season, finishing third in their division, they got hot in the playoffs. Why is Antetokounmpo not as popular as Olajuwon in Nigeria. On defense, his rare combination of quickness and strength allowed him to guard a wide range of players effectively. [23] Olajuwon posted exceptional playoff numbers of 37.5 ppg and 16.8 rpg, plus a record for points in a four-game playoff series (150). On defense, the big man can rebound and block shots. I call it the 'touch landing.' Olajuwon established himself as an unusually skilled offensive player for a big man, perfecting a set of fakes and spin moves that became known as his trademark Dream Shake. [17] Had the Rockets made the deal, Olajuwon states the Rockets could have selected Michael Jordan with the number two pick to play alongside Olajuwon and Drexler, who had established chemistry playing together during their Phi Slama Jama days in college. The Rockets finished the 1990–91 season with a record of 52–30[19] under NBA Coach of the Year Chaney. The Houston Rockets selected the hometown hero as the No. "[60], Olajuwon married his current wife, Dalia Asafi, on August 8, 1996, in Houston. This change also coincided with the hiring of new coach Don Chaney. Michael Jordan had returned from an 18-month hiatus in March 1995, and his Chicago Bulls dominated the league for the next three years (1996–98). He is considered to be one of the greatest basketball players of all time. [46] When asked later what a team could do to "solve" Olajuwon, Robinson told LIFE magazine: "Hakeem? [28] Despite his usual strong numbers, he could not lift his team out of mediocrity. The Rockets posted a 57–win season in 1996–97 season when they added Charles Barkley to their roster. In the 2006 NBA offseason, Olajuwon opened his first Big Man Camp, where he teaches young frontcourt players the finer points of playing in the post. Nonetheless he was not traded and the Rockets began the season with a new coach, Rudy Tomjanovich. [37] In stark contrast to the previous year, the Rockets entered the 1993–94 season as a team on the rise. Olajuwon's scoring production rose to 18.9 points per game,[23] and he made his twelfth and final All-NBA Team. On March 9, 1991, he altered his name from Akeem to the more conventional spelling of Hakeem, saying, "I'm not changing the spelling of my name, I'm correcting it". On August 2, 2001,[52] after refusing a $13 million deal with the Rockets, Olajuwon was traded to the Toronto Raptors for draft picks (the highest of which was used by Houston to draft Boštjan Nachbar at #15 in the 2002 NBA draft), with the player having a three-year contract that would give him $18 million. [62][63] Olajuwon also has an older daughter, Abisola from a previous relationship with Lita Spencer, whom he met in college. His college career for the Cougars included three trips to the Final Four. [81][82] Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık, Donatas Motiejūnas, Amar'e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, JaVale McGee and Kenneth Faried. The Rockets ended the regular season with a record of 45–37,[19] and Olajuwon finished the season as the league leader in rebounds (13.5 per game) by a full rebound per game over Charles Barkley. When the league was suspended on March 11, 2020, the Bucks held the league’s best record (53-12) and Antetokounmpo somehow had better numbers in the 57 games he had played than he did last season, when he won his first MVP. Hakeem Olajuwon's House in Sugar Land, TX (Google Maps) The retired professional basketball player lives here. He missed two weeks early in the season due to an accelerated heart beat. He runs the camp for free. After Sampson was traded to the Warriors in 1988, Olajuwon became the Rockets' undisputed leader. Hakeem Abdul Olajuwon (/əˈlaɪʒuɒn/;[1] Yoruba: [olaɟuwɔ̃]; born January 21, 1963), formerly Akeem Olajuwon, is a Nigerian-American former professional basketball player. Back in the city where he made his name, Olajuwon is once again involved in the game of basketball. He and his teammates (including Clyde Drexler) formed what was dubbed "Phi Slama Jama", the first slam-dunking "fraternity", so named because of its above-the-rim prowess. It would accomplish one of three things: one, to misdirect the opponent and make him go the opposite way; two, to freeze the opponent and leave him devastated in his tracks; three, to shake off the opponent and giving him no chance to contest the shot. We helped from different angles. [80] In the 2011 offseason, LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. [42], On December 1, 1994, Olajuwon recorded a triple-double 37 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists in a 113–109 win over the Golden State Warriors. After being down 2–1, the Knicks took a 3–2 lead into Game 6. [9] Olajuwon did not play basketball until the age of 15 in high school, when he entered a local tournament while at the Muslim Teachers College in Lagos, Nigeria. [79] More recently he has been working with Dwight Howard, helping him diversify his post moves and encouraging more mental focus. He finished second in the MVP race to Charles Barkley with 22 votes to Barkley's 59. 1 overall pick in the 1984 NBA draft. [29] He also expressed displeasure with the organization's efforts to surround him with quality players. Born in Lagos, Nigeria, Olajuwon traveled from his home country to play for the University of Houston under head coach Guy Lewis. [23] This willingness to pass the ball increased his scoring, making it more difficult for opposing teams to double and triple-team him. That immediately I pick up the game and, you know, realize that this is the life for me. You don't solve Hakeem. The next season Olajuwon teamed up with a familiar face, former Cougars teammate Clyde Drexler. The Rockets had immediate success during Olajuwon's rookie season, as their win-loss record improved from 29–53 in 1983–84 to 48–34 in 1984–85. “Don’t call me MVP.                             privacy policy   and European users agree to data transfer policy. "[6] The Rockets won every road game that series. I was soaking up the faith and learning new meanings each time I turned a page. The best footwork I've ever seen from a big man. It was a discovery that would change the game of basketball. During his 18-year NBA career, Olajuwon earned more than $107 million in salary. They were bolstered in part by the acquisition of Clyde Drexler, Olajuwon's former University of Houston "Phi Slama Jama" teammate, in a mid-season trade from the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon first played University basketball in Nigeria before he was drafted while Antetokounmpo was drafted straight from the second division in Greece.
