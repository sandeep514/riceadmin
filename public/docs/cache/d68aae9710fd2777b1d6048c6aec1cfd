We have identified these works in the following photos from our exhibition history. The first of these oddly shaped squashes appeared in a work Kusama made in 1946, a full 10 years before she relocated to the United States and began making the work that would catapult her to fame. From the late 1950s, after she had moved to the United States, Kusama attracted attention by presenting large paintings repeatedly depicting meshes or polka dots. “I paint polka dots on the bodies of people, and with those polka dots, the people will self-obliterate and return to the nature of the universe,” she later wrote in her autobiography. These are works Kusama made during her two-month-long stay at Lucio Fontana’s studio in Milan while she was having an individual exhibition in that city. This record is a work in progress. Indeed, Kusama became just as influential as that of her modernist, male predecessors. Below, we explore her monumental influence through six deeply irreverent, important works. Our site uses technology that is not supported by your browser, so it may not work correctly. In 2002, for the installation “The Obliteration Room,” Kusama put polka dots into the hands of visitors themselves. Courtesy of the Cleveland Museum of Art. Want to know how some of the 20th century’s most celebrated artists made abstract paintings? In the short film, Kusama is something of a ringleader, bringing people, animals, and environments together by anointing them with little circles. “My sofas, couches, dresses, and rowboats bristle with phalluses,” Kusama once said succinctly, when describing her sculptures from the 1960s. Installation views. F., in which she played with the notion of infinite repetition and infinite space. Attracted to the social freedom and teeming postwar art scene in the United States, Kusama left Japan and moved to New York City in 1958. Over the next several years, Kusama inserted herself more boldly into New York’s public spaces. In 2018–19, MoMA collaborated with Google Arts & Culture Lab on a project using machine learning to identify artworks in installation photos. Yayoi Kusama has 112 works online. In one Happening, she went grocery shopping wearing a phallus-adorned dress and matching hat. Can a single polka dot change the course of art history? One of her first three-dimensional works, But the forms she began to affix to found objects, like armchairs and ladders and shoes, weren’t so much nets as protuberances: soft, stuffed conical forms that looked more like fields of waving seaweed or forests of penises. They gathered and danced in high-profile, bustling places—like the, While polka dots are Kusama’s most recognizable motifs, pumpkins are a close second. The Yayoi followed the Jōmon period (14,000 BC – 1,000 BC) and Yayoi culture flourished in a geographic area from southern Kyūshū to northern Honshū. In other words, obliteration offered the artist an access point into a more fantastical, unrestrained world. While the expansive white of her canvas presaged the monochromes of the Minimalists, her use of thick, intricately webbed impasto hints at something more personal and obsessive. This course offers an in-depth, hands-on look at the materials, techniques, and thinking of seven New York School artists, including Willem de Kooning, Yayoi Kusama, Agnes Martin, Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, Ad Reinhardt, and Mark Rothko. She has consistently been pursuing expressions in which meshes and polka dots are accumulated and repeated. “By obliterating one’s individual self, one returns to the infinite universe,” Kusama explained in 1999. And the Japanese artist has much to celebrate. If you have additional information or spotted an error, please send feedback to [email protected]. Her early “Infinity Net” paintings, begun in the 1950s—monochromatic canvases filled with thousands of tiny dots—paved the way for, Kusama has said that her artwork is an expression of her life, and particularly of her obsessive-compulsive neuroses.

In fact, her nets can be seen as a material form of the patterns that Kusama experiences in hallucinations, a condition that has afflicted her since childhood. Covering sheets of paper with miniscule, repetitive marks not only fed her love of art, but also helped her cope with the stress-induced hallucinations she’d experienced from a young age. It is a rare work Kusama, who migrated from Japan to the United States and swept through the times in diverse fields from painting to performance, gave birth to in Europe in the 1960s. In a 1961 article titled “Under the Spell of Accumulation,” Kusama described the impulses behind these canvases: “I gradually feel myself under the spell of the accumulation and repetition in my ‘nets’ which expand beyond myself, and all over the limited space of canvas covering the floor, desk and everywhere,” she wrote. They also influenced the burgeoning Pop art movement, which used household objects and the repetition of images and forms to explore consumerism and mass production. More information is also available about the film collection and the Circulating Film and Video Library. In recent years, they’ve become the major draw of Kusama retrospectives, transporting viewers into a kaleidoscopic black hole of shimmering dots, while also providing the perfect backdrop for a selfie sure to inspire lots of likes.

The film points to the sense of freedom Kusama found in repetitive mark making. Kusama went on to name this series of objects “Compulsion Furniture.” She later described. Attracted to the social freedom and teeming postwar art scene in the United States, Kusama left Japan and moved to New York City in 1958. By the time Kusama left her native Japan for the United States in 1956, she’d already begun her practice of dot-making. Avant-garde Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama was an influential figure in the postwar New York art scene, staging provocative happenings and exhibiting works such as her “Infinity Nets,” hallucinatory paintings of loops and dots (and physical representations of the idea of infinity). “By obliterating one’s individual self, one returns to the infinite universe,” Kusama explained in 1999. If you notice an error, please contact us at [email protected]. Kusama saw the room as the manifestation of a “long-cherished dream” to be sublimated by her own art. Today, at 89 years old, Kusama continues to create—spreading her ever-accumulating dots, and the sculptures and paintings they cover, around the world. Since 1965, Kusama has produced over 20 “Infinity Mirror” rooms, including one for the Japanese Pavilion at the 1993 Venice Biennale. (She’s described these as being a result of her mother’s violence and vehement disapproval of her artistic aspirations.) Psychologically, the process of making these paintings was a form of catharsis for the artist, who sought to obliterate her fears and even herself through the act of repetition. A year after she made the film, Kusama began describing herself as the “High Priestess of Polka Dots,” and her SoHo loft as the “Church of Self-Obliteration.” It was there, in 1968, that she officiated a wedding between two gay men (an illegal union in New York at the time). In 1977, she entered a Tokyo sanatorium for treatment of her compulsions, and has been living and making art there ever since. In 1965, Kusama erected the first of her now-famous immersive environments. F., in which she played with the notion of infinite repetition and infinite space. It depicted the kabocha—a kind of pumpkin used extensively in Japanese cooking—rendered in the late-19th century Japanese painting style of, It wasn’t until the 1970s, though, that pumpkins reappeared in her work, as a means of fusing abstraction and representation. Using colorful stickers, they collectively transformed a vapid white room into a warm, colorful sanctuary.
