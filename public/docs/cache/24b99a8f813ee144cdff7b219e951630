It happened when two men in a white Mercedes-Benz and two other men in a white Ford van pulled up to the Crown Liquor store at the Dadeland Mall in Miami. He has been in the Broward County Jail since 1988 on federal drug charges. Police said convictions of the three men would wrap up a violent era that prompted Metro-Dade police, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Miami police to form a task force called Red Rum -- murder spelled backward -- to combat a rise in drug-related homicides a decade ago. The audacious gangland hit foreshadowed a coming decade marked… Blanco’s brother-in-law Miguel (Paco) Sepulveda and her most trusted hit man Jorge (Rivi) Ayala blasted Panesso and Panesso’s muscle, Juan Carlos Hernandez, away with uzi sub machine guns in broad daylight at the swanky Dadeland Mall on the afternoon of July 11, 1979. The brazen robbery of drug kingpin German Jimenez Panesso’s Miami home in the spring of 1978 set off a chain of events eventually resulting in the infamous Dadeland Mall Massacre in nearby Kendall, Florida over a year later. Blanco owed Panesso over a million bucks and saw Suescun’s beef with Ramirez as a way of sliding out of her debt. The audacious gangland hit foreshadowed a coming decade marked by further bold acts of violence, droves of flashy Colombian and Cuban drug lords landing on the shores of Miami and swashbuckling their way to tremendous levels of wealth and power riding the wave of the Great American Coke Boom of the 1980s and the transformation of the area from a dusty, quiet retirement community to a polished, trendy, pastel-painted paradise famous for hedonism, celebrity vacationers and life in the fast lane. In 1980 the city had 573 murders in the year, and the next year had 621 murders. It's all part of the same organization," Sgt. The drug war was triggered by the 1979 Dadeland Mall shootout; in broad daylight, two gunmen of a Colombian drug gang entered and shot two men at a liquor store. Ayala has been charged in the murders of Atehortua and Garcia, but is serving a sentence for attempted murder in a California prison. After the boy was killed, his father, Jesus Castro, who was identified by detectives as the bodyguard of a narcotics kingpin, washed the body, wrapped it in clean sheets and dumped it on the steps of a Miami mosque. Escobar died a fugitive of the law in a hail of gunfire in 1993 as he shot it out with Colombian military and DEA agents refusing to be taken alive on the roof of a Medellin safe house. The hit team arrived in a white van with the words Happy Time Complete Party Supply on the side. Personally I miss 1980's Dadeland mall, the arcade and the play area was the best, I loved the smell of Burdines, and my dad would drive us down the circular ramp on the way out. She was indicted again in the early 1990s while behind bars after Rivi Ayala flipped and tied her to more than 20 gangland slayings in New York and Florida. Al Profit & Scott M. Burnstein. Police suspect Atehortua was killed because he owed Blanco money. Blanco was indicted on federal narcotics and racketeering charges in 1985 out of New York, convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Deported to Colombia upon finishing her prison time in America in 2004, Blanco was killed in a drive-by shooting in front of a Medellin butcher shop in the fall of 2012. In the early afternoon hours of July 11, 1979, Rivi Ayala and Paco Sepulveda, went into the Crown Liquors store at the Dadeland Mall with uzis and unloaded a barrage of gunfire into Panesso and Hernandez, who were at the counter purchasing bottles of Chivas Regal. Suescun was partners with Miami drug don Carlos Panello Ramirez. Police think the three men were paid enforcers for Blanco, also known as La Madrina, or The Godmother. Griselda Blanco was known variously as the “Queen of Cocaine”, the “The Black Widow” or simply La Madrina—”The Godmother.”And she died in a hail of bullets Sunday in Colombia, dispatched in the same way she had allegedly ordered dozens of others killed during her rise to power as one of the biggest drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere. This mecca of fabulous fashion and dining destinations spans more than 1.4 million square-feet and features more than 185 retail stores and restaurants. Panesso and Ramirez were both being supplied their cocaine by Colombia’s Medellin cartel and its female crew boss Griselda (The Godmother) Blanco, a top lieutenant of narco-terrorist and global villain Pablo Escobar.

Dolphins’ Tua Tagovailoa gets response from ‘celebrity crush’ Shania Twain, Twin baby girls found at scene of fatal shooting in Pompano Beach, Hospitals filling up, encountering a new kind of coronavirus patient. Panesso and Hernandez were at the front counter of Crown Liquors buying bottles of Chivas Regal when they were slain. As the assassins exitted the crime scene, the unthinkable happened, they began to … Three men who police say are linked to the 1984 machine-gun slaying of a Hollywood man may be part of the ring of drug cartel hitmen that made its grisly debut in the 1979 Dadeland … The decision of local drug world heavy Jaime Suescun to burglarize Panesso’s residence in April 1978 put the whole bloody mess into motion. However, no charges have been filed against the three men in connection with the Dadeland Mall shootout, police said.

Six days later, on April 23, 1978, Suescun was lured to a Miami Beach townhouse under the pretense of selling the 10 keys of blow he lifted from Panesso’s place.

When police arrived, they found Suescun’s body in the trunk of an abandoned black-colored Audi and four of Panesso’s men (Ruben Echeverria, Julio Gaona, Jorge Luiis de Campo and Osear Penagos Rios) scattered dead in the same parking lot. While dumping the body that night, Panesso’s men got into a shootout with Suescun’s soldiers, who had followed their boss to the sham coke deal. Police released these details about the suspects: --Velasquez, 32, was arrested by Hollywood police on Tuesday and charged with the first-degree murder of Rodrigo Atehortua at his Polk Street home in 1984. She ordered a squad of her most reliable assassins to murder Panesso as a favor to Ramirez. With the drug wars, a shootout could breakout anywhere at all.

The Broward State Attorney's Office is trying to extradite him. On April 17, 1978, Suescun and his crew ripped off Panesso’s pad for $500,000 and 40 kilos of cocaine.  Ayala was a suspect in a number of signature  “Cocaine Cowboy” slayings of the 1980s and eventually became a witness against Blanco in court.

The pair were the focus of the cult classic 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys helmed by Billy Corben. All Rights Reserved. The seeds of the bloody shopping mall assassination plot were planted in the spring of 1978 when Panesso began feuding with Miami crime boss Carlos Panello Ramirez after Ramirez’s partner robbed Panesso’s home. Two Crown Liquors store employees were wounded in the attack as well. The video says the west part? Panesso, 37, and his bodyguard Juan Carlos Hernandez, 22, were gunned down at Dadeland Mall’s Crown Liquors… An incensed Panesso vowed swift vengeance.
