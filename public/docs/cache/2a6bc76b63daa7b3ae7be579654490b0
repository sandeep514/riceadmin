No players left Manchester United in the 1999 summer transfer window. With the game seemingly drifting away from the English side, Ferguson introduced striker Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r with 10 minutes remaining. Mark Bosnich, previously at United as a reserve goalkeeper from 1989 to 1991, returned to the club as Peter Schmeichel's successor, but failed to live up to expectations and in September, the club swooped for Italian Massimo Taibi to provide competition for him. [80] Scholl then almost scored from a delicate 20-yard chip after a run from Basler, but the ball bounced back off the post and into Schmeichel's arms. Bayern Munich's fans, meanwhile, created a tifo of the name of their team with thousands of coloured cards.[63]. United took the lead just before half-time through a Roy Keane strike from just outside the penalty area; however, Hasan Salihamid≈æiƒá equalised for Bayern in the 55th minute and the game finished in a 1‚Äì1 draw. The 1999 FA Cup Final was an association football match that took place on 22 May 1999 at the old Wembley Stadium in London to determine the winner of the 1998‚Äì99 FA Cup.It was contested between Manchester United and Newcastle United.Goals from Teddy Sheringham and Paul Scholes gave Manchester United a 2‚Äì0 win to claim their 10th FA Cup title. [99] For Bayern Munich, substitutes Thomas Helmer and Ali Daei left the club in the summer of 1999, with Helmer moving to England to play for Sunderland and Daei remaining in Germany with Hertha BSC. [22], Manchester United received ¬£2¬†million in prize money from UEFA for winning the competition, on top of the ¬£10¬†million they had already won just for reaching the final; by comparison, Bayern Munich received ¬£1.6¬†million for finishing as runners-up. [122] The Bayern squad featured six players who appeared in the 1999 final ‚Äì Markus Babbel, Samuel Kuffour, Stefan Effenberg, Lothar Matth√§us, Carsten Jancker and Thorsten Fink ‚Äì as well as striker Giovane √âlber, who missed the original match through injury. [110] While Manchester United finished the season as Treble champions, Bayern ultimately lost the DFB-Pokal final to Werder Bremen, which meant they finished the season with the Bundesliga title as their only silverware. Of these, around two-thirds were reserved for the two finalist clubs (approximately 30,000 tickets each).                 at the end of the season, and he produced the goals when it mattered; in the F.A. [42] In the second leg, Nicola Ventola pulled a goal back for Inter, but Paul Scholes secured United's passage to the semi-finals with a late away goal. At his best when it mattered, his vital stops from However, Beckham answered his critics by consistently providing some Also new to the squad for 1999‚Äì2000 were French defender Mika√´l Silvestre and South African winger Quinton Fortune. [52], The Camp Nou was constructed over three years from 1954 to 1957 as a replacement for Barcelona's previous home, the nearby Camp de Les Corts, which had reached its limit for expansion. Ottmar Hitzfeld responded with a substitution of his own, bringing on Mehmet Scholl, who immediately set up Stefan Effenberg for a long-range shot which went narrowly wide.                 also become the first English team to head the International Federation of Football [115] The broadcast attracted an average of 15.5¬†million viewers, with a peak audience of 18.8¬†million at 21:30, just as Manchester United scored their two goals. [95], Staying true to his word from earlier in the season, the match was Schmeichel's last in a Manchester United shirt, and a month later he signed for Lisbon club Sporting Clube de Portugal. [25] In the second leg, played at Partizan's ground in Belgrade, an 88th-minute goal from Lothar Matth√§us rescued a 1‚Äì1 draw to give Bayern a 5‚Äì1 win on aggregate. [citation needed], Three years after hosting its first European Cup final in 1989, the Camp Nou was selected as the principal stadium for the football tournament at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona; it was used as the venue for one group match, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and both medal matches as the host nation, Spain, claimed gold. Another chance for Basler prompted Alex Ferguson to bring on striker Teddy Sheringham. Injury time goals from Manchester United's Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r cancelled out Mario Basler's early goal to give Manchester United a 2‚Äì1 win. Beckham flighted the corner in just over Schmeichel's head, Dwight Yorke put the ball back towards the crowded area, and after Fink failed to clear sufficiently, the ball arrived at the feet of Ryan Giggs on the edge of the area.

[107] It was such a significant achievement for an English football club that Prime Minister Tony Blair took the time to watch part of the match and congratulate Manchester United from the opening of the new National Assembly for Wales in Cardiff. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but I must say that Manchester are great champions. [44], United again came up against Italian opposition in the semi-finals, facing Juventus, who had beaten Greek side Olympiacos in the quarters, and Bayern were drawn against Ukrainian side Dynamo Kyiv, who beat reigning champions Real Madrid to reach the semis.                 topped the table with 380 points, two and a half points ahead of second-placed Palmeiras.  The result meant that Bayern finished as group winners, but United's points total was enough to see them go through as one of the two group runners-up with the best record. The victory completed a treble-winning seasonfor Manchester United,  aft‚Ä¶ John Curtis joined Blackburn Rovers on 31 May for a fee of ¬£1.5¬†million, while Michael Twiss joined Port Vale on 30 June on a free transfer.

Manchester United beat Br√∏ndby 6‚Äì2 in their first match at Parken Stadium in Copenhagen,[31] then 5‚Äì0 at Old Trafford two weeks later. [32] Bayern also recorded a pair of victories over Barcelona, winning 1‚Äì0 at the Olympiastadion[33] and 2‚Äì1 at the Camp Nou.                 United were still chasing all three trophies and had still to face the away leg of their It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. It's come for Dwight Yorke. Injury time  goals from Manchester United's Teddy Sheringham  and Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r  cancelled out Mario Basler's early goal to give Manchester United a 2‚Äì1 win. All three players had slightly different careers at United and all stayed at United for a different number of seasons: Fortune spent seven years at Old Trafford, and his career was mixed; Taibi turned out to be a major flop and left after just one season; Silvestre left in 2008 and had a successful career with United. [78] Babbel was originally intended to play a man-marking role on Ryan Giggs, with his defensive abilities earning him selection ahead of the more attack-minded Thomas Strunz;[75] however, this was nullified by Giggs' selection on the right wing, where he would play against Tarnat.             in any format without the prior written permission of the authors.

It was the first time the Treble had been won since PSV Eindhoven in 1988; it would not be won again until Barcelona beat Manchester United in the Champions League final 10 years later. [112], Manchester United planned an open-top bus tour of the city of Manchester the day after the game, at which they would parade their three trophies for an expected 700,000 people lining the streets between Sale and the city centre. [43] Meanwhile, Bayern won convincingly at Kaiserslautern, as goals from Effenberg, Carsten Jancker, Mario Basler and an own goal from Uwe R√∂sler gave them a 4‚Äì0 win, 6‚Äì0 on aggregate. During the season they scored 128 goals. [56], As well as reducing the capacity of the stadium, UEFA also mandated that the Camp Nou pitch be narrowed by 4 metres (13¬†ft) from 72 metres (236¬†ft) to 68 metres (223¬†ft), to match UEFA's 'standard' pitch size. The goal was timed at 90+0:36'. United won the Premier League title for the sixth time in eight seasons (with a record 18-point margin and 97 goals scored) as well as becoming the first English club to win the Intercontinental Cup when they defeated Palmeiras in Tokyo.
