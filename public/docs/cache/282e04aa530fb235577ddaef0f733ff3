John McBurney Hallie The Beguiled is a 1971 American Southern Gothic film directed by Don Siegel, starring Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page.                                                 :                                                  :                                      Miss Martha said I should shave you.                                     Are you dyin', Mr.                                     Sometimes, don't you think of yourself as a sleeping beauty in a castle, waiting for the prince to free you - with a kiss?                                          Amy They taste of the woods and the clean air and mysterious shadows where pretty little elves dance together. Cpl.                                      Meanwhile, Martha convinces the others (except for Edwina, who is not present) that they need to kill John to prevent him from denouncing them to Union troops who have made camp within sight of the school.                                              While the offbeat film is ultimately successful, it does bring out Siegelâs worst stylistic impulses.                                     Say a pray for me, will ya? A young girl tries to find her way in life, suffering from her own naivety and sincerity.                                                 :  John McBurney   (as Charles Briggs).

If the pain gets too great, I'll ask Hallie to bring you some (wine).
