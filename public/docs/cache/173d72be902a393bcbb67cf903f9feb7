There were a couple of things he said no to, but they were things I wasn’t particularly desperate to do anyway. :) But along the way, let’s look at ourselves and the way we treat one another, and maybe say something very much worth saying about who we are and what we can aspire to be. After watching him mainly play a good guy. I could do a couple of days in LA and get back to wherever I was shooting movies. Colm Meaney on if he was disappointed not getting a DS9 movie. Best love/hate stuff since McCoy and Spock. Colm Meaney is always a bright spot, whether a project is fair or foul. All right then, carry on. Colm bought the town drinks. They’d write me out of two or three episodes, or have me shoot the last day of one episode and the first day of the next episode. DS9 could not do a film justice, the format was perfect for TV but one  or three of the characters could just not carry a film. ", Damien commented: "‘Do you ever feel stupid in Star Trek’. Colm added: "So he was sort of ashamed of that and ashamed of me being in it. I work (unwillingly) in banking, and I get to see every day how much things have changed, both in the physical nature of Dublin, how old buildings are either given a new lease of life, or gotten rid of completely to make way for new, shiny ones, and also in the personality of the people. Rick sat me down one day and said, “I promise you, I’ll always let you out to do a feature you really want to do.” And over the course of the seven years he did. Trek’s version would be proud of him. :D. #21 Colm will be playing Gene Hunt in “Life on Mars.”  I wish him well, but for anyone who watched the BBC version, it will be hard to see someone new in that role – particularly since i’m sure it will be watered down for US television. Cable, obviously, has had a big influence on that with shows like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under and stuff like that, but it’s affected the networks now. Remember him as Jimmys Dad in the Commitments..brilliant casting…, “It’s funny, a lot of people who watch Star Trek know I do that, but they don’t know I do movies too, and similarly people who go to the movies don’t know I did Star Trek.”, Don’t worry, Colm, I know you did Star Trek AND I know you are in movies. 52 comments so far. “It was just to raise awareness of the theatre, generally,” Meaney said, “but particularly about the backstage and front-of-house people. He’s an absolute hoot in the film ‘The Van.’  An exec at my employer is Irish, and he said Meaney is highly regarded on the Emerald Isle. While other businesses have begun to open, the actor said he “felt like there wasn’t any attention being paid to theatre”. 30, I agree. In contemporary television you couldn’t do that, so I realised the value of science fiction as a genre by doing the show. #TommyTiernanShow,  loving the interview with Colm Meaney on #TommyTiernanShow its great craic , Twitter user Padraig said: "Only Tommy would get away with asking a guest if they felt stupid in their job!! It’s not a double negative. We’ve developed this wealth that has brought a certain arrogance to the people, which frustrates me. It was nice how they (later on) just admitted they were friends; and dropped the pretense of disliking each other (as they did in seasons 1,2). Oh yeah, he can play a freakin leprechaun but he won’t reprise the O’brien character – that makes sense. ", Davi said: "Did you ever feel stupid in Star Trek? Interesting bit about how he had two careers, one in Star trek and one in movies. https://www.wealthypersons.com/colm-meaney-net-worth-2020-2021 It’s nice to hear from another Roddy Doyle fan. ;-) ). We got on very well. My money is on Nick C is for Cookie when we’re talking Irish Trek actors. A report from The Irish Sun documented Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine actor Colm Meaney's recent appearance on the television news show Claire Byrne Live. During the interview, Tommy asked Colm whether he ever felt stupid while he was filming the show. I know they exist but it never made any sense to me. Slingshot us around the sun so we can time travel and restore someone’s immortal katra soul or something. Executive Producer Alex Kurtzman says he’d love to see Star Trek films and TV come together; Discovery showrunner Michelle Paradise reflects on Jonathan Frakes’ positive influence on the franchise; plus the answer to this week’s trivia. Biting the hand that feeds him? Can’t wait for “The Cage” or Colm Meaney in HD! ", Derek also said: "Loving the interview with Colm Meaney on #TommyTiernanShow its great craic.". A report from The Irish Sun documented Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine actor Colm Meaney's recent appearance on the television news show Claire Byrne Live. It’s like I’m these two different actors in two different careers, and that’s great – I love that. His role in Con Air was good, I think that’s the one he had an old Corvette and it was destroyed. The idea of Gene Hunt in the US in the era of the likes of Dirty Harry abd Streets of San Francisco is an intriguing one! The dude is a fan, making a dud episode is completely unacceptable. 22. Yeh, nice bloke by all accounts, my wife met him when she worked in Dublin at the Shelbourne Hotel about 12 years ago and said he was a lovely down to earth fella, but that’s the Irish for you!! Recloaking. Hahaha #TommyTiernanShow, Did you ever feel stupid in Star Trek ? I could just f–k off and do what I wanted, but I was a series regular on DS9. News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. Every weekday. :-D. ‘doesn’t regret never doing’ is totally fine. Nice to see he was never really typecast after TREK…, I will always remember him singing The Minstrel Boy with Captain Maxwell…. Also, I feel I’m at a point where I want to do other stuff, I like to mix it up, but I’m just as happy doing good TV. People refer to Ireland as “the land of a thousand welcomes”, but since we’ve developed prosperity, we’ve been experiencing a lot of immigrants coming to the country, and Irish people, rather than realise that this was the position we were in many years ago and relate to these people, instead begrudge them the opportunity to do something with their lives like we did when we flooded the United States, the UK and Australia. Colm Meaney was possibly the most normal “everyman” to ever appear in Star Trek. “and how he doesn’t regret never doing a DS9 film.” Ouch. You get to live at home and you’re not on the road all the time, they pay you decent money, and the writing’s good. One of my favourite moments was when he got to say “bollocks” when some piece of alien technology exploded in an episode of DS9 when Molly went missing and came back as an adult. Classic Tommy #TommyTiernanShow, Colm Meaney & Tommy Tiernan together . Surprising to hear someone say something positive about Rick Berman! I think if you start stepping into the feature world in Star Trek you become known to a wider audience as that and it becomes limiting. Michael Hall & William: I’m a life-long northsider, and can certainly say Barrytown is very much removed from what Dublin is like now. Colm Meaney appears in an promotional video for Performing Ireland. Learn more. Always liked him and his movie roles. I think it won’t be long until these things come crashing down and Irish people realise what the really valuable things in life are. Meaney is about to go back to regular series television as one of the stars of the American version of Life on Mars being produced by David E. Kelley for ABC. "The Sun", "Sun", "Sun Online" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited. Hey, he’s in a movie with the glass-eyed pirate from Pirates of the Caribbean! His comments on what he learned about the value of SF reminds me of what I like to say to folks who talk about the degree to which Star Trek is Science Fiction at all: “Yes, it is, and its sciences are primarily psychology, sociology, and anthropology … the ones that, without shows like Star Trek, TV would scarcely go near. During the show, Colm also spoke about his father on the show and said the "whole acting thing baffled him". Life On Mars was a very well received series on the BBC, and I’d no idea he was doing the American version, so I hope it does well. It’s funny when ya’ see him in other films how ya’ forget he was Miles O’Brien… unlike some other actors associated with their parts… I means ta’ say, why is Cap’n Kirk practicing law?  Colm Meaney is about the only person out there I could imagine taking on the role of Gene Hunt other than a certain Mr Glenister! ‘doesn’t regret never’. I haven’t been back since I left though so I’m not sure about now. But I tell you. Doug Abramson:  Agree totally. Fans of the show found this absolutely hilarious as they say he would be the only presenter who could get away with asking such a question. And, indeed, Star Trek fans might enjoy some of Roddy Doyle’s other work, too. No, absolutely not! Plus I put in a little Tao of Beatty™ refrenz for those who pay attention to such things. Kurtzman seems to think so! Would love to know his thoughts on the ep where he’s sitting opposite a lephrachuan. Brilliant, just what I’d ask. It is a job. In the interview, Meaney discussed his efforts to help theatre workers in Ireland who are unemployed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. What craic. It was one of his best performances. He’s entitled not to be a fan of Star Trek. That’s awesome. To inquire about a licence to reproduce material, visit our Syndication site. O’Brien is in a movie with Gareth from The Office! The better writing now is very often found on television. Just top class. 8. ", Ger commented saying: "Colm Meaney & Tommy Tiernan together.
