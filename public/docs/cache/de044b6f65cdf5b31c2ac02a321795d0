The 2011 Wimbledon final would put the world No. The pair first faced off at the quarter-finals of the French Open in 2006. Djokovic and Nadal met six times in 2008, Nadal improving his career advantage against Djokovic to 10–4, winning four of their encounters. Mary Carillo and John McEnroe both commented that the Australian Open match and the 2013 French Open semifinal match were the two best matches played on hard and clay courts respectively. Here are the details of the French Open 2020 final between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. It was the first time since November 2010 that Nadal had beaten Djokovic. With the numbers speaking in favor of the Spaniard, he’ll certainly be the favorite. 2 ranked Djokovic who was looking for his first Wimbledon title. Djokovic won again the semifinal at Indian Wells[42] and at the quarterfinal stage of the Rome Masters putting the rivalry at 26-23 in Djokovic's favor with a 7 match winning streak against Nadal. While results will speak of one-sided domination, it might be noted that he is yet to be tested. [22] The match, at 4 hours and 3 minutes, was the longest three-set singles match on the ATP World Tour in the Open Era (later surpassed by the Olympic semifinal between Federer and Del Potro in 2012, which did not have a tiebreak in the third set).

Nadal leads 7–1 at the French Open and 2–1 at the US Open, while Djokovic leads 2–0 at the Australian Open and 2–1 at Wimbledon. The sixth and final battle of the year came at the Beijing Olympics in the semifinals, Nadal winning the match. A similar complaint could be made to the tennis community by Serena Williams, who is constantly overlooked when it comes to Grand Slam title records. Of these matches, 16 have been in Grand Slams with Nadal leading 10–6. [33], They met for a second consecutive final at the US Open, a rematch of the final from the previous year, in which Nadal had prevailed. Nadal also won their only match so far at the Davis Cup in the 1st round tie of the 2009 event. The match had momentum swings throughout the entire affair but the most important occurred late in the fifth set when Djokovic, up a break, touched the net on a winner that would have put him in position to serve for the match, losing the point. [12] They then met for the first time on grass, in the semifinals of Wimbledon. Nadal won their only meeting at the Olympics in the semi-finals of the 2008 event. Djokovic eventually lost in the final to Stan Wawrinka. Djokovic is second all-time in total titles at the event (tied with Pete Sampras and Ivan Lendl), behind Roger Federer (6 titles). Rafael Nadal won that match 6-4, 6-4 after Djokovic retired midway. Djokovic and Nadal met again in the 2012 Monte–Carlo Masters 1000 final. In exactly the same fashion the player leading by a break in the 5th set committed a hauntingly uncharacteristic error (Nadal missed an easy backhand pass at 30–15, 4–2 in the fifth in Melbourne, while Djokovic ran into the net after hitting a what would have been a clean winner at 4–3 in the fifth in Paris) only to spark a momentum shift for their opponent to break back and ultimately win the match – Djokovic broke back to win the Australian Open 2012 final 7–5, while Nadal broke back to win the French Open 2013 semifinal 9–7. Djokovic and Nadal faced off for the first time in a Grand Slam final at the US Open. After having split the first two sets, Djokovic conceded the match to Nadal on a retirement. The first ever meeting between the two occurred at the 2006 French Open in the quarterfinals, where Nadal prevailed after Djokovic retired with an injury in the third set. Djokovic is the only player to defeat Nadal in three consecutive grand slam finals and the only player to defeat Nadal in all four grand slams (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open).

Someone unacquainted with the game might never know that Williams, Margaret Court and Steffi Graf each have more than 20 titles to their name. [citation needed] The amount of social media chatter on Facebook and Twitter on the match was never seen before in tennis. The actual greatest rivalry in tennis was between Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert and the latter was quick to point this out. Djokovic won the match, going 2–1 in the round robin phase.[26]. Well, true... in men’s tennis... @Martina and I played 80 times.. https://t.co/ZB7031gL4c. The third set entered the tiebreak and Djokovic saved three set points to win the set.
