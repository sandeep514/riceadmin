YuchenKim Dec 12 2017 8:47 pm  Rating 9/10: Great & Awesome Drama. Felt like this with Suzy before but I survived watching her in WYWS. I'm so tired of bad idol wannabe actresses being cast in dramas just for the extra promo. Hoyagoo Dec 26 2017 11:19 pm  I've never seen hyeri's drama before, but I feel uncomfortable with netizen's comment that do not like her. Reverdrama Aug 26 2017 5:46 pm  Gong Soo Chang’s soul retreated into Cha Dong Tak’s body. I already dislike Hyeri’s character and the body switch was random and cliché. Dora the Explorer Jun 08 2019 9:17 am  . I've watched ep 1/2 and it is absolutely fun! Two Cops 2017 K-Drama Review/Recap. Donahmee Nov 17 2017 4:01 pm  theturtle Apr 03 2018 9:05 am  Looking forward for next episodes.. ^^. Song Ji Ahn saved students. kendall Park Jul 31 2017 6:54 am  The idea is great , at the beginning is good , after second arc starting to go down hill after that writing is bad and it get boring quick .Not gonna remember this drama after a while . :), Molen Nov 30 2017 6:52 pm  How come that the director chosen her when shes not good! I don’t know why but it’s really working my nerves. I cannot bear to watch the female lead. Clip. Come on guys.. Cho Jun Seok as always nails his performance and Hyeri i think she's good. Hyeri is definitely a good actor as i xan at least conclude from here last drama that i watched which starered Hyeru t was Reply 1988 but i was not able to watch Entertainer i tried watching it only because of Ji Sung and his finomial acting skills in all his projects but it was sich a was waste maybe others must be having a different view than i do so no offense. I think hyeri a good Actress absolutely a good actress, Dont jugde soo cruelly, because she enough doing the best to be song ji an? I find cho jung soek and Lee si young could made a beautiful couple. so like a year ago i started watching this drama but i stopped at like eps 3 i think bcs this genre is not my cuppa tea.

Dear PD nim, can you wait for Yoochun to return and offer the swindler role to him.you'll never regret . As to the critics of Hyeri, I don’t know what your problem is, but you all need to get a life. I like the other guy his funny.. all the best. First of all, great story. Cha Dong Tak fell in love with what Song Ji An ate. //<!

But.. Oh my god! Please consider. I am not sure why people hate her here. fighting Hyeri GD...I am support ur.... sun&moon Oct 04 2017 5:20 am  She is doing a good job and way better than a lot of the actors that are terrible, but so many rave about them. | Privacy Policy | Contact, First script reading took place late September, 2017, http://asianwiki.com/index.php?title=Two_Cops_(Korean_Drama)&oldid=1183531. omg ... hopefully not Hyeri !! It would have been a shame if he actually did die in the end after all those ghost adventures we went through (ahem, 49 Days), but the show could have done a better job with that. I mean just Imagine her being a cop. And don't expect much romance while watching bcs romance ia not the focus here lol. Special to Melon Dec 01 2017 8:03 am  Hopefully she cancel this drama . Sorry to say :-/. and the bromance of jjs and ksh is real! I'm just here rejoicing at the cast *hearts in eyes*. Agree the story is cliche, but as long as I can see Mr. Dimples on my screen, who cares? I know that she can do better and i believe she can. But i really wish it doesn't have the similar ending where most of it is unseen. Gosh...so hard to choose, Hmmm .. KHS though is so cute. So .. Am Ithe only one who thinks the age difference is disturbing xD but I do like tha drama a lot. Migthy Thor Mar 05 2018 10:18 am  Might not be as well as i expected it to be but still good enough. always love some bromance and there sure was a lot of that in this rom com. this will be his first role as hyeongsa!

Two Cops Korean Drama Review Posted on January 24, 2018 by Kay Two Cops is about a moral and upright detective (Jo Jung Suk) who ends up having his body inhabited by the spirit of a con artist (Kim Sun Ho). Rocks Dec 10 2017 10:14 pm  Still can't beat Han JiMin acting !! The thing that I disliked the most was that the story became a little draggy and boring in the middle and I was actually thinking about dropping the drama but it got so much better towards the end. updatebox(1,W4GRB.average_rating[1]); Eva Feb 05 2018 7:12 pm  Common guys that a bad habit. Cho Jung-Seok is a really good actor. OLT Aug 05 2017 12:23 am  Jong suk has different style in this drama.

And i really hope that he'll be on more dramas after this. kpopandgrime Oct 03 2019 5:25 pm  I have much fun watching this drama. Jade Aug 01 2017 8:53 pm  I should do come report on this movie.This is 100% cool movie I ever watch on kdrama......... V Jul 03 2018 2:49 am  Say no this drama Hyeri Aug 11 2017 1:24 pm  window.W4GRB = new Object(); it's really addicted since it's about crime and the action scenes are as good as in movies (jo jungsuk nailed it)! Cha Dong-Tak is a detective in pursuit of justice. shubha_indo Nov 22 2017 5:17 am  I'm looking forward for the next episode! [CDATA[ Thanks for this art ??? But i would say this is not Hyeri's best work she can do much better and i hope i can see her again with a better drama and a little bit of a better acting skills. I missed my lodi so much! ?fighting mga lodi...!! And this drama is absolutely fun. i think ji an (hyeri) character isn't that necessary ? I'm a bit disappointed. He is not adorable handsome but he is too much cute and sweet.. Im not saying that the male lead role is ordinary one but im feeling that im looking forward to Kim Sun Ho Than Jo Jung Seok... Simglo Jan 18 2018 4:23 pm  Laughing on all those hyeri bashers...This was the same case with Reply 1988 when everyone was judging her until she proved them wrong..HYERI FIGHTING! It is different from other detective or police drama and has its own unique story, directing, so it is so fun to watch. I wish the drama is more focusing on the friendship between Song Tak and Soo Chang. I think Jung seok is one of the best Korean actors. I do remember enjoying the humor in this drama though and the small character (relationship) developments. hyeri's acting maybe lacking but i hope that it will improve for the coming episode., Kprim Dec 06 2017 11:35 pm  I seldom leave any comment for the drama i watched, but when i do, that means i have something that i want people to know about that particular drama. I've just watched the first episode. sometimes I cant even remember who is the characters name mentioned.coz two many people died juat because of the damn 16 yrs ago incident.I must say story and character writing are weak...hyeri acting IF you wana compare to senior and good actors..then i must say a disappointment.. may be she didnt suit this role.sorry.i cant feel her character...too young?may be....esp her tone sometimes felt out of space is she rapping or si ging .kih3.. she act better in reply 88 may be cuz of the casts that seems to work well with her?. Too bad Han Jimin didn't accept the offer. I fell inlove with ur eyes, voice and especially your acting skills.. I'd be happy to see that. A swindler's spirit takes possession of his body. W4GRB.user_rating[1]=0; there is no need to criticize hyeri like other netizens. hope soon u will get Lead Role as well. He don't need anymore screen time. who the saying hyeri is not OK she is the best for this drama and I really miss her in dramas I can't wait am really excited, eun jiso Sep 15 2017 4:10 pm  He's multitalented i can say. There is comedy, drama, action and of course romance! Nevermind, I can watch other drama in the same time slot. I mean instead of continuously moving back and forth with the character of Gong Soo Chang, the writer should have stick to the individuality of the two characters, once or twice is okay but repeatedly, OMG, it becomes boring and predictable. K-Drama Review / Recap. But their is other actresses like Kim so ra . God, her acting skill is so annoyingly bad (sorry to say). All rights reserved.  I love also the bromance since Sun ho delivered his character as well aside from the fact that they are both so good looking duo!
