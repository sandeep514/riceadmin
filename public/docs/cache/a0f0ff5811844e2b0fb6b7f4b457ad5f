There are plenty of stories yet to be adapted from the Books of Blood (including our favorite, the classic, “In the Hills, the Cities”), so the possibility of doing more movies–or going back to the original idea of an anthology TV series–seems like an obvious way to go if this first entry is a success. “Books of Blood” is now streaming on Hulu. Anna Friel (Marcella) stars in the moving alongside Britt Robertson (For the People), Rafi Gavron (A Star Is Born) and Yul Vazquez (Midnight, Texas). As their stories interweave and we learn about the mission of a mercenary (Yul Vazquez) who’s trying to retrieve a book worth an extreme amount of money, the twists will keep viewers guessing on the outcome for these characters until the very end. I came in during the moment when she was going down into the apple cellar to see Mrs. Bates. For my complete interviews with the cast, click here. It’s a whole different kind of mind to deal with, which is wonderful. And then, of course, we set out together on a weekly basis for several hours every week, starting to talk about what stories we would like to do.”, Braga does admit that the initial idea was for a TV series featuring different stories every week. Start your free trial to watch Books of Blood and other popular TV shows and movies including new releases, classics, Hulu Originals, and more. In some ways, it’s a book about triumph.

Ballot Drop-off Locations; What You Need To Know, Exclusive: Sheriff Bianco Confident DNA Results of Missing Couple’s Remains Will Help Bring Justice, Officials Confirm Remains Found are Those of Coachella Valley Missing Couple. The idea of telling three short narratives, in the way that Brannon has here, was ideal. It’s on the slow train. The arrival of Clive Barker’s Books of Blood in 1984 and 1985 was an earthshaking event in horror literature. Born in New York City, currently ensconced in Los Angeles, his earliest childhood memory is…, Nightbreed TV Show Lands Godzilla Director, Clive Barker Returns, Clive Barker Says We’re ‘Living Through’ A Time Of Horror, Hellraiser TV Series Being Developed by HBO, How Welcome to the Blumhouse Explores the Horror of Family, Upcoming Horror Movies in October 2020: Theaters, Streaming, and VOD, How Hunt A Killer Expands the Blair Witch Universe with New Horror Game, Topps' Fright Flicks Cards: Where Horror and Comedy Collide, Best Horror Movies on Netflix: Scariest Films to Stream, Is It Wrong To Try To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon? I think it’s more about how little horror we’ve actually had since the Books of Blood came out in ‘86 or ‘87. 			 Braga and Simon executive produce with Fuzzy Door’s MacFarlane and Erica Huggins, Alana Kleiman, Brian Witten, Jeff Kwatinetz, Josh Barry and Barker. Short fiction is not popular anymore, unfortunately, and sometimes horror stories are best told in a short form. The film, which hails from Fox 21 Television Studios and MacFarlane’s Fuzzy Door Productions, is slated for premiere in fall 2020. “A lot of characters, we meet them, we meet again, and then they come to some sticky end or another,” continues Barker. Press J to jump to the feed. Barker's works commonly include social commentary as well as themes pertaining to … No less an authority than Stephen King called Barker “the future of horror,” leading to a tsunami of acclaim for the six volumes of collected short stories. It’s been frustrating for me because I’ve wanted to make that into a movie pretty much since I wrote it. For me, it’s one of those books that’s like Winnie the Pooh for me because you can read it in different decades of your life and find new meaning in it, each time. Brannon Braga's Hulu original horror movie Books Of Blood is adapted from Clive Barker's six book collection of the same name — here's each story that the movie adapts.. Clive Barker has become a horror legend over the years with his movie adaptations such as the Hellraiser franchise and Candyman. Oliver Parker, who is a friend of mine since he was 17 or 18, and has directed a whole bunch of wonderful movies, is now directing it. Hulu's new horror film Books Of Blood begins by teasing the whereabouts of the titular tome. How did this guy…?’ The stories had no vampires, they had no werewolves, none of the traditional horror elements. Clive, I love all of your work but my favorite story of yours has always been The Thief of Always. Even as somebody who was there with its creation, I was still shocked at how powerful the sequence was, for instance, when the spirits come through and all the lights go out and we come back, all that stuff was pretty impressive visually, and I wasn’t ready for that.

We have a body of narratives, which are Clive and Brannon’s Books of Blood. When the shocks really start to come along, where the blood really starts to get shed, is not in the conventional place in a horror movie.”, As for incorporating an original story with existing Barker material, Braga says that even that emerged out of his conversations with the author. Now, the director, who co-wrote the script as well, adapted one of Barker’s most popular titles, “Books of Blood.”  Co-starring in the scary flick is Yul Vasquez as the assassin Bennett. We’re hoping this movie does well because we would love to do a Volume 2. We’ve got a lot of stories already chosen from the Books, but we thought a bunch of secret projects. Two of the stories are Clive Barker originals that we developed together, and one has been absolute necessary to the movie, because it’s the origin story of the Book of Blood.”, “I feel as though I, as a creator, owe my readers surprises,” adds Barker. I hope we’ll be able to do many of these.”. Joe Micucci, Jason Clark and Michael Mahoney are producers. We’re always surprising each other. However, while this Hulu original may share a title with Barker's masterful horror collection, showrunners Brannon Braga and Adam Simon have made a lot of changes to the source material. Copyright © 2020 Penske Business Media, LLC. Books of Blood is streaming on Hulu starting today, Oct. 7. Clive, what is it like for you, at this point, to see your material turned into these different projects and still have such an interesting, new and different point of view, from various filmmakers? What the audience later learns is that this book isn't really a book at all. Every story is so original, and so different in tone. Barker himself directed Lord of Illusions, based on the Books of Blood story “The Last Illusion.”, Now a new original movie, also called Books of Blood, is premiering on Hulu after initially being developed as a possible TV series.

These were images you never thought of. BARKER: The fun thing is being able to mingle something which was written 35 years ago, and add to it.

He’s my favorite collaborator. I don’t think there was a week that went by, where we didn’t create something new. While I have written long books myself, they tend to be fantasies and not horror. “It was kind of like the Beatles releasing all their albums on the same day. Everything gets an extra wham of narrative and surprise. Books that have a certain simplicity to them, which I think The Thief of Always does – it’s a fable – can reward you in different ways, depending on how you feel when you went to pick it up. BRAGA: Most of the DNA was laid as Clive and I decided to take the title story from the first story in the first volume as one of the stories, and then there were two other amazing ideas that Clive had been thinking about for quite some time. Speaking of the latter, a number of stories from the books were adapted for the screen, including the title tale itself (which acted as a framing device for all the stories), “The Midnight Meat Train,” “Dread,” and “The Forbidden,” the latter of which formed the basis of the soon-to-be-rebooted Candyman franchise. Friel will play Mary, a brilliant, beautiful psychologist who has gained fame as a skeptic that debunks all theories or beliefs that are not solely scientifically based. Directed by Brannon Braga (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Salem), written by Braga and Adam Simon (Salem), and executive produced by Seth MacFarlane (The Orville) and Barker himself, the film is an anthology inspired by Barker’s books that features two mostly original storylines and a third loosely based on the story “Book of Blood.”, “It came about after decades of dreaming about being involved in some adaptation of the Books of Blood as an anthology piece,” says Braga when asked alongside Barker about the genesis of the project during a Zoom chat.
