But due to Nabokov’s prose, the stories told me thousand times by my Grandmother and stacked somewhere in the depth of the memory miraculously got alive and transformed into the vivid pictures of a sunlit apple orchard, Cossacks suppressing students rally, train tours to the Crimea. While reading “Speak, Memory”, I tried to answer two questions: 1) What may an American reader like about the book? However, there are additional details that either signify his personal psychic energy or else some biologically inherited psychic ability—the ability of synesthesia. . For me, with my freshly learned English, Nabokov’s prose seemed kind of staged: stylish and exquisite as his unique Russian but a little tied up in the limits of English grammar. Olga, Thank you for posting and for including your lovely essay. He asks the reader to take a closer look at his melancholia and indulgence. Throughout the book the reader gets a sense that someone is prodding Nabokov, asking questions to further his stories, to encourage him to more acutely remember details—initially it can be assumed that he is metaphorically speaking to Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory, but towards the end of the book he begins using the pronoun “you” and it is revealed that this is Vera, his wife and whom he has dedicated the book to. I suspect my views of Speak, Memory will continue to change. That “wide ripple” and “gluey” “dark swell” are pretty darn good, too. The book, a Russian translation copied from the original printed in the West and hand-bound, was secretly given to me by a friend with a comment, “If anybody asks you where you got it, answer that you found it in a dumpster.” I’m not sure if the original was smuggled through the Iron Curtain, probably the friend just wanted to heat my interest. Why? He counted on the former to help him make living but it was the latter which turned out to be a great commercial success. I borrowed the book in the library, and it had some notes and a library receipt which told me about the previous reader. He does not go back because he knows that that Russia is gone. While reading the book, I caught myself several times feeling as if I was looking through the eyes of my Great-Grandmother whose namesake I am and whose youth coincided with the beginning of 20th century. And then his beloved father is, by the way, assassinated.

Interesting! 2.0 | NARRATIVE. He succeeded, according to his own ruthless standards. That pretty well sums up my feeling, as a reader, to be honest. My grandfather lived in St. Petersburg around the time that Nabokov did, so perhaps for me reading the book was partly a way to get to know my family’s past. I love the way that Nabokov captures the Russia of his time. I expect even more miracles. It sounds like “Speak Memory” reveals Nabokov as a wonderfully talented cold fish. He enjoys his simple life with his wife and his small son, but he always longs for the Russia of his childhood. Speak, Memory: An Autobiography Revisited by Vladimir Nabokov. Knopf’s does include a never-before-published final chapter, Nabokov’s pseudo-review of the book. “Speak, Memory” works as a magic lantern switching the reader from the narration to his or her own or even ancestral reminiscences. It seems Nabokov is discovering what is happening as he writes and has not constructed thought, memory or story before sitting down at the page. Nabokov’s memory, especially in regard to the first twenty years of his life, is almost abnormally strong, and probably he had less difficulty than most memoirists would have had in following the plan he set himself: to stick to the truth through thick and thin and not be tempted to fill gaps with logical verisimilitudes posing as preciously preserved recollections. And then in Speak, Memory, we see a young boy hearing of the World War on the Western Front. The Russia that Nabokov knows and remembers is one where he experiences an elite wealth and sheltered entitlement. Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email. .

Its episodic nature, for instance, its heavy leaning on “summary and reflection” and its “downplaying of events”: the book is so artful a thing that I’m not sure whether it reveals more about the workings of Nabokov’s memory or about his chosen methods, but I feel there’s a good deal of the former in it. I was glad to find your review, because pondering it helped me work out my thoughts on the book.

Regarding the use of “you” (about which I was unsure of your opinion), which appears only occasionally until the 15th chapter, I eventually grasped, as you did, to whom it refers. While grateful for the editors’ “minor improvements” to the grammar of this non-native writer, Nabokov skirmished to preserve his rhythms, allusions, dry jokes, and artifice. I liked his novels especially those written in Russian a lot, and “Drugie Berega” (Other Shores) has become one of my favorite books. We are thankful for their contributions and encourage you to make your own. […]. Nabokov's command of language has been a subject of literary criticism for a long time, especially regarding what some consider to be the best novel ever written by any human, Lolita. No doubt, “Speak, Memory” may be interesting to an American reader as an exotic butterfly for its unusual and mysterious beauty. The book produces the strongest feeling of home and loving family – the values which cannot be overestimated. As for me, I’ll probably never return to “Lolita” and will definitely reread both “Speak, Memory” and “Drugie Berega” which connect distant shores and times and serve as bookmarks in the memory pinpointing treasured places and images. My tart response to the book (really to Nabokov himself) has sure provoked interesting responses. Speak, Memory is divided into 15 chapters that follow Nabokov’s life chronologically through his early adulthood. He never mentions his two sisters and youngest brother, but notes that the role of this number two kid, Sergei, was to watch him, the young genius named after his father, be coddled and favored. Novelist and critic James Woods, in his Slate essay “None Too Human” on Nabokov, says of the master’s performance in Speak Memory, “I don’t want him to be more truthful so much as a little less artistic; not more open but differently closed (if you’ll allow me the paradox).”, Filed under: aesthetics, honesty, memoir, biography, REVIEW or retrospective, theme, Really enjoyed this, Richard. Knopf, 268 pages. The memoir embodies the writer’s conviction that “this world is not as bad as it seems.”, Published first as a series of essays over many years in The New Yorker, and compiled as a book in 1947 after “more or less thorough rewriting,” in Nabokov’s phrase, Speak, Memory seems less cohesive than the great novelist’s fiction.

At one spot a lone light dimly diluted the darkness and transformed the mist into a visible drizzle. What makes Nabokov different from the rest of us, it seems, is that he has been amazed by life from a very young age with an insatiable curiosity that privately led to the birth and growth of true artistic genius. He asks for not a whit of sympathy—quite the contrary—when his idyllic world is shattered. The search for the adequate translation haunted me even in a night dream where I could easily reach the book, turn the pages quickly but still could not find the corresponding page. Speak, Memory is one of my favorite memoirs. This perhaps helps explain the book’s sparing dramatization. As I came quite close to the lapping water, I saw what it was—an aged swan, a large, uncouth, dodo-like creature, making ridiculous efforts to hoist himself onto a moored boat. As for my personal impression of the memoir, it hasn’t changed a lot after reading the English version. Alas, it was just a dream. Thanks, John.

Only living abroad one may feel the overwhelming beauty of the native land.

Writing in English, Nabokov preserved grace and magic epitomized in his Russian prose. I read Lolita quickly, liked it partially because of the romantic flavor of forbidden reading, and forgot about Nabokov for years. The heavy, impotent flapping of his wings, their slippery sound against the rocking and plashing boat, the gluey glistening of the dark swell where it caught the light—all seemed for a moment laden with that strange significance which sometimes in dreams is attached to a finger pressed to mute lips and then pointed at something the dreamer has no time to distinguish before waking with a start.”.
