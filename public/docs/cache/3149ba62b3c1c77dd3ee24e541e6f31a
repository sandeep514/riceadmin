She narrows her eyes. “Well…I’m a fast learner, I’m never ill, I only live on the other side of the castle, and I’m stronger than I look…probably strong enough to help move your husband around—”, “My husband? My modest wages had been a little bedrock of housekeeping money, enough to help see the family through from week to week. That you might miss the people you worked with, no matter how little you had in common with them. Not weather for the bike?”, Mick shakes his head. You’re pretty enough.” He nudged me as we ran, as if I should be grateful for the compliment. But when a young, 16-year-old girl turns up at her flat, Lou begins to realise that she has to start living again. I really liked Me Before You. It filled in so much more of the emotion the film could barely touch on. As I reached down to unplug it, I caught a movement in the corner of my eye and jumped, letting out a small shriek. It is slowing, sending a fine spray of water as it slows on the opposite side of the road. The embarrassing thing was not that I was wearing my mother’s suit, or that it was in a cut last fashionable in the late 1980s, but that it was actually a tiny bit small for me. It sounded feeble. “So why are you leaving this job, where you are clearly so well regarded?”, “Frank—the owner—sold the café. “These”—he held up another bottle—“are the antibiotics he has every two weeks for his catheter change. I keep the cupboards stocked. Not necessarily in a good way. “Well, why not?” Mum looked as if she might actually sit down—everyone paused briefly, but no, she was up again, helping Granddad to some gravy. Everyone has had the same idea. But even as I had ridden the bus home, the same thoughts had already started buzzing around my head. “Dinner. “This is the annex. These he needs fairly often to control his muscular spasms—you will need to give him one midmorning, and again at midafternoon. There was a man bungee jumping from a cliff, his arms outstretched like a statue of Christ. I am ashamed to admit that it took me weeks to pick up the book. It’s a…a private position. “No.” I filled a glass with tap water and drank it. I had never considered that you might miss a job like you missed a limb—a constant, reflexive thing. I turned the corner onto our street (68 steps), and could just see the house—a four-bedroom semi in a row of other three- and four-bedroom semis. “Believe me, when you’ve done shifts at a chicken processing factory, working in Guantánamo Bay for six months looks attractive.” Oh, shut up, Louisa. A second sequel, Still Me, was published in January 2018. “Right,” he says. “Bye, love,” he said, the corners of his mouth twitching. “I’ve watched you these six months becoming a whole different person,” he tells Louisa, “someone who is only just beginning to see her possibilities. You look very…businesslike.”. You and he will have to work out your level of interaction for yourselves.”. Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2016. We sat there in silence for a moment. “You mind if I go and talk Miss Clark through your meds, Will? “Right. Several, in fact.”, I raised an eyebrow. But caring for Lily interferes with both Louisa’s job prospects and her new romance. There was a problem loading your book clubs. You want me to call a taxi for you?”. “Short for Louisa.”. In fact, those happy endings and sad endings only have meaning because they exist together. I felt my face flood with color. “So, Miss Clark, why should I employ you instead of, say, the previous candidate, who has several years’ experience with quadriplegics?”, I looked at her. “Well…can I get you anything?”. “And we need to get this due diligence thing worked out before Martin gets in—”. After You sees Lou struggling to cope after the devastating loss of Will. Nathan gets in contact with her and offers her a job in the USA. There was a fine film of sweat on his face. “Everyone’s far too casual these days.”, “Because wearing pinstripes will be vital if I’m spoon-feeding a geriatric.”, “I can’t afford to buy a suit. Filming begins in April, with Sam Claflin (The Hunger … There's a problem loading this menu right now. I’ll be in at lunchtime to change it all. “When…you’re stuck in a wheelchair?”, “I suppose that’s one way of putting it. We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article. “Not to be given to anyone else. I stared at the folder in front of me. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Factory work, machinist, roll butterer. I haven't seen the movie, but I am glad to have read this book. Me Before You, has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide. I realized that where I held my bag, my knuckles had turned white. There’s always a moment, or a lot more than a moment, of despair—a recognition that things could go horribly wrong, and probably did, or would. Do you believe that this item violates a copyright? “Teaching him bad language.”, “It is not. This is the spare room so that Nathan can stay over if necessary. Understandable, given…the circumstances. I’ll see you at eight o’clock tomorrow.”. “Um…I’ve never actually done it,” I said, adding, as if I could hear Syed’s voice in my ear, “but I’m sure I could learn.”, I faltered. While Jojo doesn’t want to give too much of the plot away, she did say this: “With her usual blend of humour and emotion she (Lou) has to ask herself some pretty fundamental questions – not least which side of the Atlantic does she really belong? Powerful, moving, thought-provoking and with appropriate bits of humour to soften the seriousness. His jaw was covered in several weeks of stubble, and his eyes were unreadable. In Me Before You (2012), Lou is hired to care for Will Traynor, a deeply depressed, wealthy young man paralyzed in an accident. And how often was that stiff mother of his going to be around? The thought of it being her son had thrown me. “It might be worth bearing in mind for the future. I think it’s best that we start afresh then.”. And Louisa herself asks the paramedic if she is paralyzed. Still Me will revisit Lou and show us how far she’s come since Will’s death. BlackBerry makes me feel like Miss Gooseberry.” The pout again. At the book’s end, as she reads his last words to her in a Paris café he asked her to visit for him, the two are together on the page. It continues the story of Louisa Clark after Will's death. I liked the fuggy bacon-scented warmth of the café, the little bursts of cool air as the door opened and closed, the low murmur of conversation, and, when quiet, Frank’s radio singing tinnily to itself in the corner. “People looking for a new opportunity. There was a man who might have been Will in what looked like a jungle, and him again in the midst of a group of drunken friends. After You is a romance novel written by Jojo Moyes, a sequel to Me Before You. Oh God, I thought. He said it like he might be the only person who did.
