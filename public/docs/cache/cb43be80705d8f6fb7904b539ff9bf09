Mr. Morgan announced his sport as “mintonette” and his presentation would include two teams of five men to demonstrate the game and its rules. He chose a court roughly 30 feet wide and 60 feet long (probably close to 25 x 50 at first), to ensure the game could be played in gymnasiums all around the country. William G.

Mr. Halstead suggested that the game was a masterpiece, however, the name was a little lacking…. In turn, international tournaments could be organized utilizing the rules set forth by the new international federation. 8. • 1999: Introduction of rally scoring.
