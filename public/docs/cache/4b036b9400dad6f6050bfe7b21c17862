The movie presents lot of mysteries of the world in visually fascinating way. ("We love people who have died—what's the social utility in that?"

This one is not for action fans. the tactile beauty of the movie’s 35mm and 65mm textures isn’t matched by a sense of composition. The story is enthralling and you feel the anxiety of the people who are struggling to survive and help others to do the same thing. I have never seen anything like it.

No other filmmaker working today is as determined to use blockbuster spectacle to say something big about our world – even as he sends his characters zooming away from it, through wormholes, at light-speed. Science Fiction Movie. Doubling down on the Kubrick comparisons, he’s made his own sweeping space odyssey in which a team of astronauts, led by Matthew McConaughey’s stoically smouldering Coop, venture into the great beyond in search of a new home for humanity. Outside, there are enough wonders to fill an entire Dawn Treader cruise: frozen clouds that hang in the sky like weightless glaciers, tidal waves as tall and wide as mountain ranges, strands of pure time, tight and strummable as zither strings.

Cooper proudly identifies himself as an engineer as well as an astronaut and farmer, but he has the soul of a goofball poet; when he stares at intergalactic vistas, he grins like a kid at an amusement park waiting to ride a new roller coaster. I can't describe anything. He prefers shooting on film to digital cameras, and strives to achieve special effects on set rather than at a computer-graphics workstation. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. impressive, at times astonishing movie that the possible exception of the last act of ", and the pit sequence in "The Dark Knight dead language, and stare through red-rimmed eyes at video messages sent years ago, by people More often it illustrates the screenplay, and there are At times, the movie's one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes Coop has faith that his daughter Murph (played by Mackenzie Foy, and later, as an adult, by Jessica Chastain) is one of them. might not otherwise excite.

I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. But the aim of Nolan’s film isn’t to reduce love to a function of quantum physics: it’s to set quantum physics and love on an equal footing, as two densely complex, destiny-steering forces his characters learn to surrender to without ever fully fathoming. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. I hope to write a longer review later, if time permits. At its heart, Nolan’s glimmering cosmic ballet is less concerned with space than time – and particularly the way it’s experienced by parents, who watch their children grow up and drift away at a speed that seems brutally out of step with the rest of the universe. in which so many major characters wept openly in close-up, voices breaking, tears streaming down their cheeks. FAQ The best of these is the lift-off sequence, which starts with a countdown heard over images of Cooper leaving his family. The film is a feast of extraordinary ideas, each one depicted by Nolan’s cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, and his visual effects team with heart-swelling grandeur. I heard that this was called "the most scientifically accurate movie" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. that defines them: their loved ones, their personal histories, their culture, Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. (they could apply to any Nolan picture post "Batman Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. The movie's storytelling masterstroke comes from adherence to principles of relativity: the astronauts perceive time differently depending on where Endurance is, which means that when they go down onto a prospective habitable world, a few minutes there equal weeks or months back on the ship. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together.
