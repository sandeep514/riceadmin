The Scotland and England were individual sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciary, and laws, though both were ruled by James in personal union. [18] Buchanan sought to turn James into a God-fearing, Protestant king who accepted the limitations of monarchy, as outlined in his treatise De Jure Regni apud Scotos. Other opinions were more mixed; David Hume wrote that 'many virtues ... it must be owned, he was possessed of, but no one of them pure, or free from the contagion of the neighbouring vices,' whilst Henri IV of France called James 'the wisest fool in Christendom'. Both Mary and Darnley were great-grandchildren of Henry VII of England through Margaret Tudor, the older sister of Henry VIII. For all his flaws, he had largely retained the affection of his people, who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the Jacobean era. 		 Securing the English succession became a cornerstone of his policy. [44] James personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. [17] As the young king's senior tutor, Buchanan subjected James to regular beatings but also instilled in him a lifelong passion for literature and learning. Mar's illness, wrote James Melville, followed a banquet at Dalkeith Palace given by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. In 1597–98, James wrote The True Law of Free Monarchies and Basilikon Doron (Royal Gift), in which he argued a theological basis for monarchy. Croft, p 48. He pushed through the Black Acts to assert royal authority over the Kirk, and denounced the writings of his former tutor Buchanan. 118–119; Willson, pp. James was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland (through both his parents), uniquely positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones. [8], James was born on 19 June 1566 at Edinburgh Castle, and as the eldest son and heir apparent of the monarch automatically became Duke of Rothesay and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland. [34], In 1586, James signed the Treaty of Berwick with England. See also Lockyer, p. 174: "During the last eighteen months of his life James fought a very effective rearguard action to preserve his control of foreign policy ... he never became a cypher.". "As he lived in peace," remarked the Earl of Kellie, "so did he die in peace, and I pray God our king [Charles I] may follow him". "[54], In the Northern Isles, James's cousin Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney, resisted the Statutes of Iona, and was consequently imprisoned. [26] On 8 August, James made Lennox the only duke in Scotland. While you will be able to view the content of this page in your current browser, you will not be able to get the full visual experience. James finally died at Theobalds House on 27 March during a violent attack of dysentery, with Buckingham at his bedside. Darnley was murdered in February 1567. Cogswell, pp. Croft, pp. [43] After his return to Scotland, he attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the Witchcraft Act 1563. "I will not thank where I feel no thanks due", he had remarked in his closing speech. [98] Raleigh's expedition was a disastrous failure, and his son was killed fighting the Spanish. "The aging monarch was no match for the two men closest to him. It cannot have been difficult to secure James's compliance, because he disliked Overbury and his influence over Carr. The care of James was entrusted to the Earl and Countess of Mar, "to be conserved, nursed, and upbrought"[14] in the security of Stirling Castle. In July Mary was forced to abdicate in favour of her infant son. The Privy Council selected George Buchanan, Peter Young, Adam Erskine (lay abbot of Cambuskenneth), and David Erskine (lay abbot of Dryburgh) as James's preceptors or tutors. 29, 41–42; Willson, pp. [167], The Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland under James was symbolised heraldically by combining their arms, supporters and badges. [127] Some of James's biographers conclude that Esmé Stewart (later Duke of Lennox), Robert Carr (later Earl of Somerset), and George Villiers (later Duke of Buckingham) were his lovers. [81] In the early years of James's reign, the day-to-day running of the government was tightly managed by the shrewd Robert Cecil, later Earl of Salisbury, ably assisted by the experienced Thomas Egerton, whom James made Baron Ellesmere and Lord Chancellor, and by Thomas Sackville, soon Earl of Dorset, who continued as Lord Treasurer. "The debts of James VI of Scotland", Wormald, Jenny (2004; online edition May 2011). In 1589, James married Anne of Denmark. James pardoned Frances and commuted Carr's sentence of death, eventually pardoning him in 1624. [50][51], It was against this background that in 1598 James VI authorised the "Gentleman Adventurers of Fife" to civilise the "most barbarous Isle of Lewis". [144], After about the age of fifty, James suffered increasingly from arthritis, gout and kidney stones. Contention as to how the arms should be marshalled, and to which kingdom should take precedence, was solved by having different arms for each country. James described his urine to physician Théodore de Mayerne as being the "dark red colour of Alicante wine". [115] Henry Howard, for example, was a crypto-Catholic, received back into the Church of Rome in his final months. On 23 January 1570, Moray was assassinated by James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh. [159] In the words of historian Jenny Wormald, Willson's book was an "astonishing spectacle of a work whose every page proclaimed its author's increasing hatred for his subject". Willson, p. 269. [168], As royal badges James used: the Tudor rose, the thistle (for Scotland; first used by James III of Scotland), the Tudor rose dimidiated with the thistle ensigned with the royal crown, a harp (for Ireland) and a fleur de lys (for France). By all accounts, James was at first infatuated with Anne, and in the early years of their marriage seems always to have showed her patience and affection. [36] During the Spanish Armada crisis of 1588, he assured Elizabeth of his support as "your natural son and compatriot of your country". James enjoyed the pomp and circumstance of the English court, and returned to Scotland only once, in 1617. Croft, p. 51; The introduction of Henry Howard, soon to be Earl of Northampton, and of Thomas Howard, soon to be Earl of Suffolk, marked the beginning of the rise of the Howard family to power in England, which was to culminate in their dominance of James's government after the death of Cecil in 1612. I will not conceal from you that people for the most part are saying that you will look through your fingers at this deed instead of avenging it and that you don't care to take action against those who have done you this pleasure." 121–124. [91] The ensuing prickly negotiations became so protracted that James eventually lost patience and dismissed Parliament on 31 December 1610. Matters came to a head when James finally called a Parliament in 1621 to fund a military expedition in support of his son-in-law. [66] By the late 1590s his championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the increasingly expected prospect of inheritance of the English throne,[67] and some courtier poets who followed the king to London after 1603, such as William Alexander, were starting to anglicise their written language. [15] James was crowned King of Scots at the age of thirteen months at the Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling, by Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney, on 29 July 1567. 3–4; Lockyer, pp. Overbury knew too much of Carr's dealings with Frances and, motivated by a deep political hostility to the Howards, he opposed the match with a fervour that made him dangerous. In 1586, James and Elizabeth I became allies under the Treaty of Berwick. "James VI and I (1566–1625)". Two years later, he married Anne of Denmark. "Probably no single event, prior to the attempt to arrest the five members in 1642, did more to lessen the general reverence with which royalty was regarded in England than this unsavoury episode." Anne died before her husband in March 1619. The Authorised King James Version, as it came to be known, was completed in 1611 and is considered a masterpiece of Jacobean prose. [168], The arms used in England were: Quarterly, I and IV, quarterly 1st and 4th Azure three fleurs de lys Or (for France), 2nd and 3rd Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland, this was the first time that Ireland was included in the royal arms). James wrote that the colonists were to act "not by agreement" with the local inhabitants, but "by extirpation of thame". "[47], The forcible dissolution of the Lordship of the Isles by James IV in 1493 had led to troubled times for the western seaboard. [51][52] The Statutes of Iona were enacted in 1609, which required clan chiefs to: send their heirs to Lowland Scotland to be educated in English-speaking Protestant schools; provide support for Protestant ministers to Highland parishes; outlaw bards; and regularly report to Edinburgh to answer for their actions. [129] Others argue that the relationships were not sexual. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. By actively pursuing more than just a personal union of his realms, he helped lay the foundations for a unitary British state.[163]. James was the only son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. In April 1604, however, the Commons refused on legal grounds his request to be titled "King of Great Britain". [53] So began a process "specifically aimed at the extirpation of the Gaelic language, the destruction of its traditional culture and the suppression of its bearers. [83] In October 1604, he assumed the title "King of Great Britain" by proclamation rather than statute, though Sir Francis Bacon told him he could not use the style in "any legal proceeding, instrument or assurance". "Kings are called gods by the prophetical, Jack, R. D. S. (1988). [161], Under James the Plantation of Ulster by English and Scots Protestants began, and the English colonisation of North America started its course with the foundation of Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. [22], Morton, who was elected to Mar's office, proved in many ways the most effective of James's regents,[23] but he made enemies by his rapacity. [156] According to a tradition originating with anti-Stuart historians of the mid-seventeenth-century, James's taste for political absolutism, his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established the foundations of the English Civil War. [135] Until Salisbury's death, the Elizabethan administrative system over which he had presided continued to function with relative efficiency; from this time forward, however, James's government entered a period of decline and disrepute. [113] James was conciliatory towards Catholics who took the Oath of Allegiance,[114] and tolerated crypto-Catholicism even at court. [155] James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes, such as the hunt; and his later dependence on male favourites at a scandal-ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy so carefully constructed by Elizabeth. 4–6; "In contrast to earlier historians, recent research on his reign has tended to emphasize the wisdom and downplay the foolishness." He married his daughter Elizabeth to the elector of the palatinate, Frederick, who was the leader of the German Protestants. Sir Anthony Weldon (1651). [73] On 5 April, James left Edinburgh for London, promising to return every three years (a promise he did not keep), and progressed slowly southwards.
