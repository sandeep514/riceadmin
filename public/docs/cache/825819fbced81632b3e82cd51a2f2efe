After hearing that Brennan reportedly can sing, Dale suddenly breaks into an impromptu, sexually related song, with lyrics about getting down on his "hairy balls," partying down there, and an incomplete request of "Why don't you lick my John..." ("Johnson"). 		Hometown: Fortunately, as Ferb predicts, the pair end up together anyway, and Phineas decides to go to Tri-State State with Isabella.  Adult Ferb, like his brother Phineas, is never seen, only mentioned. Kids may be enticed to trade the various insults that Brennan and Dale bandy back and forth like bratty kids.  The interviewer asks if that was a fart, Dale says he doesn't know, but the interviewer says it was, adding that he can taste it in his mouth, and then identifies onion and ketchup. We see Dale in his briefs while he sleepwalks. Faced with the sensible course -- say, opening a car rental franchise -- or facing his fears and opening his lungs before a crowd of important personages, Brennan proves that there is still hope. Derek's business associate comments on a miscellaneous woman's clothed "t*ts" (we don't see them).        color: '#FFFFFF' 		  She then says she wishes she could roll Dale up into a ball and put him up her vagina, adding that it's warm and cozy, and talks of feeling him up there. Ferrell and Reilly also star in the hilarious favorites STEP BROTHERS and TALLADEGA NIGHTS! Derek tells Brennan that if "you f*ck up," his business associate will eat his "d*ck" faster than something (the threat is a metaphor). ", Derek addresses Brennan and Dale with "What up, faggots?". The neighbor's dog gets Brennan by his pants leg, with the two men then struggling on the ground. At the end of the competition, Jeremy admitted the truth about his dancing and gave Ferb all the credit ("Nerdy Dancin'"). We knew Thomas Sangster from Love Actually and Nanny McPhee and he was able to express so much. He stopped by Vanessa Doofenshmirtz, whom he was particularly fond of, and backed up a bit to flirt with her ("The Chronicles of Meap"). A person comments "This sucks camel d*cks.". Some bullies (early teen and younger) taunt Dale, calling him a "fag stick" and asking if Brennan is his boyfriend and "butt buddy." Some bullies (early teen and younger, with a history of bullying Dale) taunt and then beat up him and Brennan.  	PerryGoldie (released into ocean)Steve Bucky (deceased) In the end, though, he refused to admit it to Baljeet ("Brain Drain"). 	"Rollercoaster" Isabella seems to care for Ferb as much as he does. MARY STEENBURGEN plays Brennan's mom who tries to make the best of her and Robert's adult kids living with them and acting like bratty kids.  	  They go on a safari and the boys build a highly unconventional vehicle. Various characters have varying degrees of bad attitudes (all intended as comedy), while all sorts of behavior might be enticing for some kids to imitate. Ferb has mechanical and technological skill. ("Out to Launch"). So Please Take Care Your Sisters. (Part Two)"), The boys decided to create an antique car for Candace. WILL FERRELL plays a 39-year-old man-child who still lives at home with his mom and isn't happy when they move into Robert's house where he must share a bedroom with Dale. While Phineas was trying to talk the band members into getting back together, Ferb started making music with random objects to help start a song. All of the following is played for comedy. 	Isabella Garcia-Shapiro  Buford Van Stomm  Baljeet Tjinder When he's had enough, Robert tries to wake them up, but they then attack, carry and throw him down the steps (played for comedy).

"What is your problem, man?" of a helicopter leasing company and has two seemingly perfect kids with his wife Alice (KATHRYN HAHN). About a previous fight with Dale, Brennan lies and says that he worried that Dale was going to rape him, adding that the latter said "Let's get it on." "D*ck-heads," "You can suck on it," "Ken doll crotch," "I want to get ass," "You d*ck," "Get a room," "Balls" (testicles), "This house sucks ass," "Retard," "No way kemo sabe," "You sound insane," "I'll round-house your ass," "Whore," "I'm not buying that crap anymore," "Are you out of your mind?" Alice cheats on Derek by having sex with Dale. Ferb's ancestors had lives very similar to him currently. When Nancy and Robert meet at a medical convention and instantly fall in love, that leads to their wedding and her moving into his house. KATHRYN HAHN plays his wife, unhappily married to him, who finds her libido awakened by Dale, with whom she forces herself on him to have sex. }).render().setUser('PnF_Wiki').start(); his Lost in Danville Dimension counterpart, 3 cousins named Beckham and 2 cousins named PelÃ©, Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Candace Against the Universe, Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together, Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension, Phineas and Ferb and the Temple of Juatchadoon, Unfair Science Fair Redux (Another Story), User:Topher208/Dan Povenmire Correspondence, https://twitter.com/DanPovenmire/status/860888989456375808, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michaellevin/what-makes-phineas-ferb_b_5398580.html, https://twitter.com/DanPovenmire/status/1246419087661494273, "New Cartoon Role For Love Actually Star Thomas Sangster", http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/new-cartoon-role-for-love-actually-968014, https://phineasandferb.fandom.com/wiki/Ferb_Fletcher?oldid=717398. JOHN C. REILLY plays his new 40-year-old stepbrother who pretty much behaves the same way (insults, fighting, acting like a man-child, profanity, viewing pornography). None. We see Dale in his briefs while he sleepwalks. Heavy He uses profanity, drinks, and admits to drug use.  These aren't middle-aged sad-sacks so much as overgrown teenagers -- Wayne and Garth with curlier hair. He also claims to have smoked pot in the past, but we don't know if that's true or not. He uses strong profanity, drinks, and sleeps with Nancy upon first meeting her. Ignatius then wonders how their platypus came to Africa, but then Ferb says that platypi are synonymous with the word impossible. The neighbor's dog gets Brennan by his pants leg, with the two men then struggling on the ground. Brennan and Dale aren't happy about their parents getting married (Brennan angrily states he's not calling Robert "dad"), and are even less pleased that they'll be living in the same house and having to share the same room. After catching sight of Nancy in the audience at his presentation, Robert becomes distracted and absentmindedly comments on putting one's face between those breasts.  To try to scare away potential buyers of their parents' house, Brennan dresses like a Nazi neighbor (telling the prospective buyers "Hey f*ckers"), while Dale dresses like a KKK member. 	 	 	 He was once referred by Phineas as being "more of a man of action." Dale then runs for his dad, yelling about all of the blood, but we then see just a lone bloody scrape/cut on Brennan's arm.  Linda is interrupted before she can explain what Ferb is doing at the presidential retreat, but given Ferb's British nationality, it is unlikely he has become the president of the United States. Brennan then shows that he was just faking it and hits Dale on the head with a shovel, followed by completely burying him.  Brennan loudly slurps his drink.

While driving, Robert turns around and tries grabbing at Dale in the back seat. Derek's business associate repeatedly yells out "Pow!"

Dale tauntingly tells Brennan that Nancy is really hot and that maybe he and Robert should both "bang her.".  Robert and Nancy have wine with dinner. Later, Nancy asks that he couldn't hold it, with Dale saying he thought it was going to be silent. 	Suzy Johnson (future sister-in-law)Jeremy Johnson (future brother-in-law) One day when Doof's "Babe-inator" hit Phineas and Ferb, they were turned into babies. On a visit to the beach, Phineas, Ferb, Isabella, Baljeet, Buford, and Irving goes out to look for the lost city of Atlantis. Referring to Brennan, Derek calls him "Ken doll crotch.". Dale asks an interviewer a decision-based question about women, with one you have to "f*ck," another to marry, and the last to kill. Some bullies (early teen and younger) taunt Dale, calling him a "fag stick" and asking if Brennan is his boyfriend and "butt buddy."

Brennan and Dale urinate together, having a "sword fight" with their urine streams that we see. Ferb then gets caught up in the efforts of their friends-including the former Fireside Girls-to get Phineas and Isabella together, though he tries to convince them that they can't force the relationship.   m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) When Nancy and Robert get married, the new siblings make no effort to conceal their hostility. Ferb tested Meap's spaceship out for a run when he was done repairing it.  We see a music video that Dale and Brennan made for their song "Boats and Hos" (whores) that includes them singing various sexually explicit lyrics, including using terms such as "d*ck" and lyrics such as "Every time I come, I produce a quart." Violence He also claims to have smoked pot in the past, but we don't know if that's true or not. [src], "Candace, we are just kids." However, LindaÂ got a bad hairdo at a local salon and ends up having a bad hair day.  Twenty years after he and Phineas built the Coolest Coaster Ever, Linda explains to the time-traveling Candace that Ferb is currently away at Camp David. He is the step-son of Linda FlynnÂ and the biological son of Lawrence Fletcher. Derek's business associate comments on a miscellaneous woman's clothed "t*ts" (we don't see them).  However, this may not be entirely accurate.     scrollbar: false, In response, Robert tells him, "Shut the f*ck up.". The following is a brief summary of the content found in this R-rated comedy. We see a flashback to Derek performing the song "Ice, Ice, Baby" while doing some clothed pelvic thrusting, while two women performing with him are seen in small shorts. A song explained the ride to the event, in which Ferb was the background/secondary singer. Phineas was concerned that Perry was in the forest of Africa.  They also tell their sons that they'll have to get an apartment and attend therapy. Music(Scary/Tense) According to Phineas, Ferb was impressed with Candace's bravery when she jump started their rocket that had run out of fuel ("Out to Launch"). After having sex with Dale, Alice walks over to the urinal in the men's room, spreads her legs with one up against the wall, and urinates (we don't see the stream or any nudity).
