</html>";s:4:"text";s:10173:"LSU’s challenges aren’t unique, even if the 2019 team was incredibly unique in terms of its greatness. A return to health of several key players who missed time last season as well as the arrival of another top-flight recruiting class gives Aranda the tools necessary for LSU to field an elite defense. Delpit should be a strong candidate for all national awards for which he is eligible and freshman Derek Stingley Jr. is the marquee player in a highly regarded freshman class. LSU tied for 32nd in the country last season with 34 sacks, fewer than preseason expectations would have suggested. LSU’s defense should be formidable this coming season, and Burrow showed some signs of life near the end of last season. Please sign in or register. Can’t replace Devin but overall we should see better production and more options for Aranda. The Tigers played their home games at Tiger Stadium  (nicknamed Death Valley) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and competed in the West Division of the Southeastern Conference  (SEC) where they were led by their third-year head coach Ed Orgeron. However,  I do think the D-line could stand to have some new faces step up for rotation. The 96 points surrendered are the most allowed through three games in program history. Editor’s note: After previewing every SEC East defense last week, this is the 4th in a series on the SEC West. With the depth on the defense, if LSU gets luckier with injuries than it did last season it should have the ability to improve on its punt coverage. I frequently find myself calling predictive ratings "anti-social" because of the way they seem to go out of their way to frustrate people. As a result, fatigue occasionally became an issue. This is a long way of saying that LSU, 2019's national champion and a team that finished the season playing otherworldly ball, didn't finish the year No. If the pass rush improves as is expected, opportunities will be there for big plays in the secondary and there are plenty of Tigers capable of making them. The Tigers ranked 25th in total defense last season and a lot of teams would see that as a very good season and an admirable goal for the upcoming season. In a single sentence, it's a tempo- and opponent-adjusted measure of college football efficiency. If I’m not mistaken, he was injured in the Fiesta Bowl and had an ankle injury suffered in the Syracuse game. Here you go with that BS again. He was right there with Devin statistically many games. Even better, kickoff specialist Avery Atkins did all of that as a freshman last season. The fact of the matter is, a national champion hasn’t defended its title so poorly in nearly a decade. Did I mention Miss State only scored two points in that game and was held to 275 passing yards on seventy attempts? If LSU is focused, the game’s outcome should be decided pretty early. Coming Friday: Mississippi State. I was very sad when Ed A announced for the draft. Previewing LSU's defense in 2019 Les East | 1 year ago Editor’s note: After previewing every SEC East defense last week, this is the 4th in a series on the SEC West. But victory is always sweeter after a heart stopping, down to the wire, all out battle than after a 29-0 affair. Jacob Phillips, who lined up next to White on the interior last season, and Patrick Queen, who backed up White, are prime candidates to lead the way against the run, along with Divinity, who can play inside and outside. Last year he didnt rack up the interceptions because no one threw his way. But what makes LSU’s title defense so strange is how poorly they’ve defended their crown to start this season. Orgeron: LSU fought through adversity to win title (2:51), Final SP+ rankings for 2019 college football season, Alabama remains the SEC king, Trevor Lawrence remains unstoppable and more from Week 7, Rebuilding FSU savors 'special' win vs. No. Looney continues to inspire Louisiana football, Why grad transfer success stories no longer apply to just college football elite. Will Nick Saban be cleared for UGA game? Chaasion will be back and as a whole we are deeper than last season. Losing White will hurt, but having so many guys back and healthy will more than make up for that. What is SP+? Second, all indications are that the LB room will be better than it was last year, even with the loss of White. He capitalized. LSU ranked 38th in the country in passing yards allowed but it tied for 11th with 17 interceptions and that’s a ranking that could be surpassed with the potential for an improved pass rush and coverage. Inspired by Banner Society’s Alex Kirshner’s 14 Worst Defending National Champions, I went back and looked at every defending championship team from the year 2000. I give Les East a C- on this article. Queen is super athletic but unproven. And I’m in the minority on this, probably, but I prefer a formidable LSU. The Tigers are deep in all three areas and versatile players allow Aranda plenty of flexibility based on down and distance. Its a good thing. The departure of White, who was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the No. Divinity will move inside and Queen outside. After fielding one of the greatest teams of all time last fall, producing one of the most successful draft classes in NFL history, losing key coaches on both sides of the ball and having impactful players opt out of playing this season, Ed Orgeron and his 2020 Tiger football team faced long odds of coming close to replicating the same success the 2019 team had. Play like that all year, and you're the greatest team of all time. 5 overall pick, means the absence of some 100-plus tackles that the Tigers could count on each season. The Tigers are falling, off to their worst start since 1994, and if things don’t improve dramatically LSU will be lucky to go 5-5. Two weeks ago the Bulldogs scored 14 points in a loss to Arkansas, who hadn’t won a conference game in nearly three years; Saturday night against Kentucky, K.J. You could see on the field that he was too raw. LSU’s challenges aren’t unique, even if the 2019 team was incredibly unique in terms of its greatness. I have feeling that QBs will opt to test the new young buck. That defense allowed 191.4 yards and a nation-leading 5.1 points per game. And yet Ed Orgeron and defensive coordinator Bo Pelini were totally flummoxed by Mike Leach’s air raid offense. Nonetheless LSU does like to be called DBU and as usual there’s lots of talent returning and arriving in the secondary. You probably don't get credit for head-to-head wins, and in a lot of formulas you don't get extra credit for playing particularly well in specific games. I’m not sure it’s the former but for whatever reason when LSU wins a championship, they’ve shown on three separate occasions now they struggle in the year immediately after. Whites motor was incredible, but Phillips White and queen can tackle no doubt. Les East is a New Orleans-based football writer who covers LSU for SaturdayDownSouth.com. It’s also dubious that of the four worst finishes by a national champion over the last 20 years, LSU’s name appears twice: finishing 16th in 2004, and being completely outside the Top-25 in 2008. In other words, whoever wrote this lame article is obviosly smoking crack. As it stands, their midseason defensive funk (driven in part by injuries) dragged their full-season numbers down to that of a merely tremendous team. A step back from 2019 was expected, but no one could have seen this coming. Both are expected to be healthy after undergoing surgery, and the return of end Glenn Logan and Neil Farrell also is significant. If you're lucky or unimpressive in a win, your rating will probably fall. Ohio State all but clinched the No. The athleticism of the interior linemen allows Aranda to use them as playmakers and not just space eaters. This group should be better in every aspect. I think the world of Devin white. Each week, we are giving away an ultimate homegating kit by Texas Pete. Most teams would kill for Fulton, KVjr, fat Joseph, and Derek stingley… Not to mention delpit and a HOST of capable safeties. A year ago LSU had arguably the best team in college football history, but here in 2020 Ed Orgeron’s Tigers are making history in all the wrong ways. 5 UNC, Gators coach Mullen tests positive for COVID-19, Saban coaches Tide to win after expedited test, NC State QB Leary carted off with leg in air cast, Tigers' Lawrence has huge day, misses INT mark, Vols 'undecided' at QB after Guarantano benched, "Our confidence went through the roof": Nick Saban returns and Bama rolls, College football Power Rankings for Week 7, College Football Playoff picks after Week 7, Yes, friends, even game officials can land on our Bottom 10 list, 'That energy is still here': How D.J. You’re correct that he played banged up a bit this season. It was once my favorite and most nerve-racking game of the regular season. It is not a résumé ranking that gives credit for big wins or particularly brave scheduling -- no good predictive system is. Cornerbacks Kristian Fulton and Kelvin Joseph, safety JaCoby Stevens, nickelback Kary Vincent Jr. and freshman safety Marcel Brooks provide talent and versatility to the unit. Ray Thornton and Andre Anthony as well as Damone Clark and highly regarded freshmen Donte Starks and Kendall McCallum comprise a deep unit. And it likely will be the case again in 2019, even though the defense was sub-par in some regards last season and the offense has the potential to be more productive this season. 1 in SP+, just as it didn't finish No. The LSU defense appears to be a cure-all for opposing offenses. Last season LSU allowed 339 yards and 22 points per game, so even with the injuries it was a good year that contributed significantly to a 10-3 season. The 2019 LSU Tigers football team represented Louisiana State University  in the 2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season. Go get a life. Their success hinges on the effectiveness of our front 7, as ever. In a way Fulton getting injured was huge for LSU this year. That being said, my takeaway about Lawrence from this article was not the same as yours.
