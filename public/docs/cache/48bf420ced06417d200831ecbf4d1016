"Moll Flanders Study Guide." Need analysis for a quote we don't cover? This is her second extramarital affair—the first being her relationship to the older son of her adoptive family—and she is prepared for it to end the same way: cast aside in favor of a wife of higher social standing. She is married, yet she does not have a husband by her side to protect and provide for her. She engages in a string of loveless marriages and affairs to avoid the poorhouse. The original text plus a side-by-side modern translation of. Moll has changed her identity and spun an elaborate web of lies and deceit so often that she has not been able to fully confide in anyone, not even the one husband she truly loves, Jemy. and theme. “I saw the Cloud, though I did not foresee the Storm.”, “I am giving an account of what was, not of what ought or ought not to be.”, “I had been tricked once by that Cheat called love, but the Game was over...”, “He look'd a little disorder'd, when he said this, but I did not apprehend any thing from it at that time, believing as it us'd to be said, that they who do those things never talk of them; or that they who talk of such things never do them.”, “If a young women once thinks herself handsome, she never doubts the truth of any man that tells her he is in love with her; for if she believes herself charming charming enough to captive him, 'tis natural to expect the effects of it.”, “Diligence and Application have their due Encouragement, even in the remotest Parts of the World, and that no Case can be so low, so despicable, or so empty of Prospect, but that an unwearied Industry will go a great way to deliver us from it, will in time raise the meanest Creature to appear again in the World, and give him a new Case for his Life.”, “I rather wished for their ruin, than studied to avoid it.”, “It is true that the original of this story is put into new words, and the style of the famous lady we here speak of is a little altered; particularly she is made to tell her own tale in modester words that she told it at first, the copy which came first to hand having been written in language more like one still in Newgate than one grown penitent and humble, as she afterwards pretends to be.”, “As for Women that do not think their own Safety worth their Thought, that impatient of their present State, resolve as they call it to take the first good Christian that comes, that run into Matrimony, as a Horse rushes into the Battle, I can say nothing to them, but this, that they are a Sort of Ladies that are to be pray'd for among the rest of distemper'd People...”, “That as my sister-in-law at Colchester had said, beauty, wit, manners, sense, good humour, good behaviour, education, virtue, piety, or any other qualification, whether of body or mind, had no power to recommend; that money only made a woman agreeable; that men chose mistresses indeed by the gust of their affection, and it was requisite, “Where love is the case, the doctor's an ass”, “Thus the Government of our Virtue was broken and I exchang'd the Place of Friend for that unmusical harsh-sounding Title of Whore.”, “Thus you see having committed a Crime once, is a sad Handle to the committing of it again; whereas all the Regret, and Reflections wear off when the Temptation renews it self; had I not yielded to see him again, the Corrupt desire in him had worn off, and 'tis very probable he had never fallen into it, with any Body else, as I really believe he had not done before.”. Her pragmatism takes over and with prudent foresight, she lives frugally to save as much money as she can for the future in which she will inevitably find herself alone and without a steady income. I wonder at you Brother, says the Sister; Betty wants but one Thing, but she had as good want every Thing, for the Market is against our Sex just now; and if a young Woman have Beauty, Birth, Breeding, Wit, Sense, Manners, Modesty, and all these to an Extream; yet if she have not Money, she’s no Body, she had as good want them all, for nothing but Money now recommends a Woman […]. Our, LitCharts makes it easy to find quotes by LitCharts makes it easy to find quotes by section, character, and theme. After all, they turn out to be more lucrative than a hard day of honest work. Referring to the woman who takes her in after the nurse who raised her died, Moll recounts her first move up the social ladder. Women were viewed as objectified assets, as "bags of money" or "jewels" that fall "prey" to the men in their lives. Marriages were here the consequences of politic schemes. My Colour came and went, at the Sight of the Purse, and with the fire of his Proposal together; so that I could not say a Word, and he easily perceiv’d it; so putting the Purse into my Bosom, I made no more Resistance to him, but let him do just what he pleas’d; and as often as he pleas’d; and thus I finish’d my own Destruction at once, for from this Day, being forsaken of my Virtue, and my Modesty, I had nothing of Value left to recommend me, either to God’s Blessing, or Man’s Assistance. Referring to the Mint, a seedy section of London, Moll condemns the amoral lifestyle of the criminals and prostitutes who mingle there, while at the same time testifying to the fact that the people who live at the fringes of society are as decent as they come. However, this is not the last time she will abandon her offspring. Isolation and loneliness are natural consequences of choosing opportunism and self-reliance over responsibility and emotional attachment. “She is always Married too soon, who gets a bad Husband, and she is never Married too late, who gets a good one.”, “Das kann ich, sagte ich einfältiges Kind.”, “Aber, sprach sie noch immer lächelnd, dieser Verdienst kann dir nicht Nahrung und Kleider schaffen, wer wird denn dem kleinen Fräulein die Kleider kaufen?”, “Si una joven tiene belle­za, nacimiento, educación, ingenio, sentido, modales, modestia y todo ello en forma extremada, pero no tiene dinero, no es na­die y es igual que si lo necesitara todo, porque el dinero es lo único que recomienda ahora a una mujer. That the State of things was altered as to Matrimony, and that I was not to expect at London, what I had found in the Country; that Marriages were here the Consequences of politick Schemes for forming Interests, and carrying on Business, and that L o v e had no Share, or but very little in the Matter. O let none read this part without seriously reflecting on the Circumstances of a desolate State, and how they would grapple with meer want of Friends and want of Bread; it will certainly make them think not of sparing what they have only, but of looking up to Heaven for support, and of the wise Man’s Prayer, Give me not Poverty lest I Steal. It is enough to tell you, that as some of my worst Comrades, who are out of the Way of doing me Harm, having gone out of the World by the Steps and the String, as I often expected to go, knew me by the Name of Moll Flanders; so you may give me leave to speak of myself under that Name till I dare own who I have been, as well as who I am. On the other hand, every Branch of my Story, if duly consider’d, may be useful to honest People, and afford a due Caution to People of some sort or other to Guard against the like Surprizes, and to have their Eyes about them when they have to do with Strangers of any kind, for ’tis very seldom that some Snare or other is not in their way. Course Hero. Referring to his first wife, the banker—Moll's future husband—justifies his desire for a divorce. We resolve to spend the remainder of our years in sincere penitence. The Author is here suppos’d to be writing her own History, and in the very beginning of her Account, she gives the Reasons why she thinks fit to conceal her true Name, after which there is no Occasion to say any more about that. Learn the important quotes in Moll Flanders and the chapters they're from, including why they're important and what they mean in the context of the book. However, having tasted the good life with her adoptive family, she aspires to remain a gentlewoman. Introducing her son Humphrey to Jemy, Moll allows parts of her past and her present to come together, allowing her to be herself. In the course of her life, Moll plays all these roles. LitCharts Teacher Editions. Moll is convinced the governess is devoted to her and will not abandon her, despite the fact Moll has been transported to America. Stuck? Moll finds an easy solution—she takes on a new identity. "Moll Flanders Study Guide." “Would not have made it through AP Literature without the printable PDFs. This was evidently my Case, for I was now a loose unguided Creature, and had no Help, no Assistance, no Guide for my Conduct: I knew what I aim’d at, and what I wanted, but knew nothing how to pursue the End by direct means; I wanted to be plac’d in a settled State of Living, and had I happen’d to meet with a sober good Husband, I should have been as faithful and true a Wife to him as Virtue it self could have form’d: If I had been otherwise, the Vice came in always at the Door of Necessity, not at the Door of Inclination […]. This may be thought inconsistent in it self, and wide from the Business of this Book; Particularly, I reflect that many of those who may be pleas’d and diverted with the Relation of the wild and wicked part of my Story, may not relish this, which is really the best part of my Life, the most Advantageous to myself, and the most instructive to others; such however will I hope allow me the liberty to make my Story compleat: It would be a severe Satyr on such, to say they do not relish the Repentance as much as they do the Crime; and that they had rather the History were a compleat Tragedy, as it was very likely to have been. In Course Hero. Teach your students to analyze literature like LitCharts does. Poverty brought me into the mire, so avarice kept me in, till there was no going back. Had this been the Custom in our Country, I had not been left a poor desolate Girl without Friends, without Cloaths, without Help or Helper in the World, as was my Fate; and by which, I was not only expos’d to very great Distresses, even before I was capable either of Understanding my Case, or how to Amend it, nor brought into a Course of Life, which was not only scandalous in itself, but which in its ordinary Course, tended to the swift Destruction both of Soul and Body. (including. Thus all these little Difficulties were made easy, and we liv’d together with the greatest Kindness and Comfort imaginable; we are now grown Old: I am come back to England, being almost seventy Years of Age, my Husband sixty eight, having perform’d much more than the limited Terms of my Transportation: And now notwithstanding all the Fatigues, and all the Miseries we have both gone thro’, we are both in good Heart and Health; my Husband remain’d there sometime after me to settle our Affairs, and at first I had intended to go back to him, but at his desire I alter’d that Resolution, and he is come over to England also, where we resolve to spend the Remainder of our Years in sincere Penitence, for the wicked Lives we have lived. Despite the fact her mother abandoned her because she had no choice, Moll benefits from positive female role models. The Advocates for the Stage have in all Ages made this the great Argument to persuade People that their Plays are useful, and that they ought to be allow’d in the most civiliz’d, and in the most religious Government; Namely, That they are applyed to virtuous Purposes, and that by the most lively Representations, they fail not to recommend Virtue and generous Principles, and to discourage and expose all sorts of Vice and Corruption of Manners; and were it true that they did so, and that they constantly adhered to that Rule, as the Test of their acting on the Theatre, much might be said in their Favour.
