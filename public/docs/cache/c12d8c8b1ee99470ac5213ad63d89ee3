Steven and Diane Freeling (Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) live a quiet domestic life in Californian suburb. Currently, Lutz does air conditioning and remodels in Arizona, and admits that the Amityville experience gave him a perspective on buying a home that others don't have. These bits of establishing matter vary in usefulness. From crumbling Gothic manors to bland suburban homes, here is a list of best haunted house horror movies ever made. Director, writer and producer James Wan first made a name for himself by directing Saw in 2004. But your state may let you vote during a designated early voting period. The¬†Ju-On franchise originated in the late 1990s with two straight-to-video movies written and directed by the Japanese film maker Takashi Shimizu. However, it was Stephen Spielberg who wrote, produced and directed most of the movie. Visit your state election office website to find out whether they offer early voting.

More of a surreal experience than a horror movie, House was quite popular with the audience at the time of its release but received mixed reviews from the critics. Filmed for mere $1.5 million, it earned almost a $100 million at the box office. But while her experience is a part of horror film history, it's not a part of the Hermann family's lore. American film maker William Castle became known for the gimmicks he used to promote his movies. All rights reserved. Matheson previously wrote screenplays for Rod Serling's original version of The Twilight Zone and adapted his own novel into a tense and taut horror thriller that's still being widely imitated. What is there left to write about The Shining that hasn't already been said over the last four decades? Visit your state election office website to find out if you can vote by mail. Your vote is your voice! Back in 1958, Hermann's family became nationally known after they experienced unexplained poltergeist activity in their house in Seaford, N.Y. -- an experience that inspired the 1982 film. Buying a new house presents the future home owners with many potential pitfalls: from leaky faucets to vermin infestations. That was the trigger. Bayona then convinced Mexican film maker Guillermo del Toro to help them produce the movie. In 1958, Castle promoted his thriller Macabre by offering his customers a free certificate for a $1000 life insurance policy in the case they die of fright while watching his movie. British horror film The Legend Of Hell House was based on a bestselling horror novel Hell House by the American sci-fi and horror writer Richard Matheson, most well-known for his 1954 sci-fi horror novel I Am Legend. The evil African idol causes the animatronics in the house to come alive and attack as the young, pretty cast gets picked off one by one. How well that budget is used is another story (‚ÄúMy Soul To Take‚Äù had a $25 million budget, guys), though, and ‚ÄúFears‚Äù is surprisingly effective with what it had to work with. Although there have been many Amityville books and movies, Lutz hopes to one day tell his own version. Although Saw quickly became a lucrative franchise, Wan wasn't satisfied by directing violent and gore-filled movies and moved on to more subtle horror movies dealing with supernatural possession. It's clear that ‚ÄúHouse of Fears‚Äù was made on a shoestring budget, but budget shouldn't be a criticism of a film. Soon, supernatural events begin to plague the Lambert household. Sergio G. S√°nchez wrote his screenplay for The Orphanage way back in 1996. "Explaining it is very difficult," she admitted. "The story that my parents put forward is that it was the house's fault," Lutz told HuffPost Weird News. Watch a huge selection of Horror movies on SHOWTIME. Like they do. Director Martin Scorsese considers this movie to be one of the best horror films ever made. "I felt I had my own nightmare. The movie received mixed reviews at the time of its opening, but was fairly well-received by the audience. Jack Torrance (memorably¬†performed by Jack Nicholson) is a recovering alcoholic novelist who accepts a job as an off-season caretaker at the Overlook Hotel. "I never saw 'Poltergeist,'" she told HuffPost Weird News. Wonderfully creepy in tone, Amen√°bar's movie offers one of the better - and more emotionally satisfying - twist endings in recent memory. Similar to that movie, The Others goes beyond the mere surface of its story and explores a hidden reality underneath. Share them with the others in the comments below! Heavily indebted to lavish Hammer horror movie productions from the 1960s, Crimson Peak mostly takes place in a crumbling, yet opulent gothic manor. However, a new documentary, "Real Fear: The Truth Behind the Movies," that debuted March 11 on the Chiller cable network, gives Hermann and Lutz a chance to tell the stories that inspired "Poltergeist" and "Amityville Horror," as did people behind the incidents that inspired "The Mothman Prophecies" and "Silent Hill.". The evil African idol causes the animatronics in the house to come alive and attack as the young, pretty cast gets picked off one by one. "You can tell it shaped his life, while she talks about it like she's getting her car checked. More of a surreal experience than a horror movie, House was quite popular with the audience at the time of its release but received mixed reviews from the critics.

During their night in the otherwise deserted manor, Eleanor begins to suffer from what might be attacks by the supernatural entities or - equally distressing for her - a severe mental breakdown. The story follows Eleanor (Julie Harris), a long-suffering woman who was a victim of a poltergeist activity in her childhood. Today is National Voter Registration Day! But when I was back in the old neighborhood, it all came back -- nothing had changed, except the roof of the house. Over the decades, horror movies explored all kinds of haunted houses - from crumbling Gothic manors to bland suburban homes. The children are seemingly polite but their behavior soon takes a turn towards sinister. Strange events begin to happen and their explanation is even stranger than the usual haunted house curses. Misfortune seems to plague the family as well as the Catholic priest (played by Rod Steiger) who tries and fails to bless their home. "I thought disclosure was the law in every state, but it's not," he said. Are their pranks and manipulations merely a figment of Miss Giddens' paranoid imagination or are the children possessed by supernatural evil? Part of the reason Lutz may still be affected by what happened in the house is because the entities there have never left him alone. ‚ÄúHouse of Fears‚Äù is a simple movie and that's what ultimately makes it a fun one. Written, directed and produced by the great Stanley Kubrick, The Shining is an adaptation of a best-selling horror novel by Stephen King (who, famously, was unsatisfied by this adaptation).
