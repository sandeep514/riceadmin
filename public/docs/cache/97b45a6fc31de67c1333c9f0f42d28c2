The squad was called in to rescue soldiers pinned down by insurgents at a school. The Ang Lee war drama opened in just two North American theaters last weekend where it played in the “as it was intended” format of 3D, 4K, 120 frames-per-second. <br> <br>While the studio was initially skeptical about casting an unknown person, Alwyn was able to convince them after days of such testing. [21] Since no make-up was allowed, make-up artist Luisa Abel spent months of preparation on their skin tones. They strike up a conversation and begin a flirtation. He gets in, sees Shroom's familiar icon of Ganesha and has a philosophical conversation with Shroom. Itâs, in short, a bit of a gamble. And, as long as it doesn’t necessarily supplant traditional cinema, that’s okay. It looks like he will be delivering a stunning movie experience. A flashback reveals that Billy joined the army after destroying the car of his older sister Kathryn's boyfriend, who left her after she was in a car accident that required multiple facial reconstruction procedures. "[52], On February 14, 2017, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and in an Ultra HD combo pack which contains the Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and 4K UHD versions of the film. They share a kiss. "[citation needed] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter described the film as "an absorbing character study" but criticized some of the technological aspects saying that it didn't justify "its much-vaunted technological advances. The 4K UHD version presents the film at 60 frames per second in 2D. Critics of the format at the time said it looked too much like a soap opera-type video that had the adverse effect of what Jackson was going for: it took you out of the experience. As Billy meets back up with his squad, they are attacked by the security guards from earlier, briefly triggering Billy's PTSD, which fills his mind with surreal imagery of war and death. Billy had been frozen in place all the while. Theaters Will Be Equipped to Show "the Whole Shebang, "NYFF: Ang Lee's war film 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk' divides audiences. There is a certain stage-bound feeling that makes the picture feel less like a “regular” movie and more like a mix of a video game, a virtual reality experiment, and sitting through a “back from the war” variation of Tony n' Tina's Wedding. [21], The film had its world premiere at the 54th New York Film Festival on October 14, 2016. : 'Doctor Strange' Beating 'Thor 2' By 6%; 'Arrival' Soars To $24M+ – Sunday AM Update", "Ang Lee's 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk' 2016's 3rd Best Average; Paul Verhoeven's 'Elle' Bows Strong – Specialty Box Office", "Box Office: 'Fantastic Beasts' Heads for $200 Million Global Debut", "Weekend Box Office: 'Fantastic Beasts' No.  <br>Scott Mendelson of Forbes argued that a bag of mixed to negative reviews hindered the box office potential of the film.

[3], After working on Life of Pi (2012), Lee wanted to up his use of technology in filmmaking, especially in terms of frame rate, since he thought pursuing a higher frame would help him find answers. War films in the United States are generally sold as action films, but Billy Lynn on the other hand is a drama piece. But it was a truly unique moviegoing experience. [3], Shooting close-up shots in 3D with such high resolution meant the cast could not wear make-up and could not deliver less-than-authentic performances. Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is a 2016 war drama film  directed by Ang Lee  and written by Jean-Christophe Castelli, based on the 2012 novel  of the same name by Ben Fountain. Four years ago director Ang Lee attempted to push the boundaries of visual effects and 3D with his adaptation of author Yann Martelâs book Life of Pi, which nabbed the filmmaker a Best Director Oscar for his efforts and became a worldwide smash hit. [45] The film also opened in Taiwan, Lee's domicile. <br> <br>The film stars Joe Alwyn, Kristen Stewart, Garrett Hedlund, Vin Diesel, Steve Martin, and Chris Tucker. But what sounds like another in a long list of American Sniper or The Hurt Locker-esque Iraq War movies is actually something more innovative. [3] They include 120 fps in 2D and 60 fps in 3D as well as today's current standard of 24 fps. At its best, it’s a movie that you don’t want but rather experience all around you.

As the squad leaves, Billy meets up with Faison briefly before leaving. According to Lee, "[Abel] found this silicone-based makeup because we found that it can see through skin. He would rehearse every scene beforehand and would conduct regular morning meetings with the key crew members to highlight things they needed to be alert on. The film was considered another box office misfire for TriStar Pictures, following 2015's The Walk, and according to Deadline Hollywood, it wasn't the lack of 3D 4K projectors available that factored into the film's poor box office performance, but rather that the story itself didn't resonate with critics or audiences. <br> <br>And yes, when seen “as intended” in 4K, 3D, 120fps, the picture looks entirely unlike a conventional narrative feature. I don’t know if I’ve seen the future or merely an exception that proves the rule.

Billy tells Shroom "I love you," then returns to the reality of the Bravo Squad members in the limo, each of whom responds with "I love you. [43] While it registered the highest percentage of showtimes on Friday owing to Lee's popularity in China, the attendance dwindled and deteriorated from its second day onward due to mixed word of mouth as general audiences were unable to relate to its central character. The imagery is so razor sharp it looks more lifelike than real life. <br> <br>[40] The Guardian cited different causes, saying that the Iraqi war settings—which don't usually resonate to American audiences—and the war genre itself as being tough-selling subject matter. It is revealed that once the game ends, Bravo Squad will have to return to duty. [49], Much like The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk received a polarized reception from critics, with detractors saying the process created an unpleasing video look. Billy receives a phone call from a psychiatrist to whom Kathryn had spoken, regarding a plan to get Billy honorably discharged so he doesn't have to return to Iraq, thereby sparing him further suffering. <br> In private, Oglesby tells Billy that the squad's story is no longer theirs, but instead belongs to the American people. I’m not going to say that it’s “good,” because the choices made for the 120fps format don’t help the movie as a “movie.” But it’s occasionally fantastic. <br> <br>The incredibly vivid 3D pops out at you in ways obvious (footballs flying at your face) to not-so-obvious (Steve Martin’s nose looks Roxanne-ish in close-up).
