</html>";s:4:"text";s:12022:"The crossfade of Bill exiting Marion's residence has him entering a  street scene which isn't a view from the set, the streets being open ended rather than closed, but we have an impression of it being the set with the various awnings that echo those of the set. Marion wore a choker, Domino wears one, all the women at the "orgy" will wear chokers. I, I don't really know. A peculiar line hangs above him and from it dangle breasts held by  pins (one also has perhaps a sense of photographers hanging photographs to dry). When, in a minute, Alice (Nick, Nicole) calls Bill, another St. Nick card will be apparent on the wall, as if dominating and overriding the winged cherub. The Yale bullies accost bill, replaying earlier events. At first, finding himself disinterested, he pleads weariness. At the end of the street, in the distance, we see a structure that isn't present on Google street view. 				if( jQuery("#ad-halfpage-365594-0").is(":empty") ){call_ad_new('halfpage','tn_article','ad-halfpage-365594-0','rectangle_1',{"tn_author":"'steve-b'","tn_articleid":365594,"tn_ptype":"article","tn_keyword":"false","tn_subject":"'activism', 'economy', 'financial-', 'health-and', 'inequality', 'jobs', 'racism-and'","tn_slp":""});}					 Now there are at least five at Domino's, three beside the bed and two on another wall. After watching this film so many times I don't even know how many anymore - I noticed something new I'd never thought about before. He says it's difficult to talk right now (he had choked and stuttered as he stood with Domino in front of her building, Domino had said she would prefer not to "put it into words") but it could be a while, he doesn't know how long, they're still waiting for some relatives to arrive. Then Domino, who lives next to the Lotto store (indeed the Lotto store is apartment 2, apartment 2 not existing, a door from Domino's apartment even leading into it) takes Bill in with the offer that it is nicer in there than on the street. 193 MS Bill still standing by the stereo. She was doing a Mexican lap dance right in my face. You want things to go well for them. Though the scene is also not "real" in that Tom Cruise has been filmed before a blue screen and so is not actually walking before any of these Village shops. The prostitute's profile reminds me of Dave Bowman  conversing with Dr. Frank Poole in the pod as HAL looks on, reading their lips in 2001.

The actors remark on how the audience hadn't learned a thing. You like all the characters. It will be best to conceal it." 166 LS A woman and man kissing before the flower shop Nipped in the Bud. They pass the Original Josef Kreiber Knishery, building 269, then The Lotto Store. Anyone who can imagine being watched, who has that third, critical eye examining them, may become an actor playing for that third eye. How much did you say it was? Perhaps. And not so much for any particular scene, but rather due to the overriding plot which, at least to some, makes some rather heavy hints of the reality of The Illuminati and the secret rituals they are involved with. She had a red rose in her mouth. Cut to show Bill seated on the bed covered with a Tree of Life bedspread, Domino leaning over him. 					call_ad_new('halfpage','tn_article','ad-halfpage-365594-0','rectangle_1',{"tn_author":"'steve-b'","tn_articleid":365594,"tn_ptype":"article","tn_keyword":"false","tn_subject":"'activism', 'economy', 'financial-', 'health-and', 'inequality', 'jobs', 'racism-and'","tn_slp":""});	 Venice, Italy is the idealized home, one of love and community. BILL: No. DOMINO (shrugs): It's okay. These 90 degree shifts have everything to do with presaging and making a formula of the The Shining's ending in which Danny reverses his path in the maze, makes a 90 degree angle into the hedge and covers his tracks, thus disappearing from Jack and saving his life. Tourist, from tour, has in it the idea of "a turn, trick, round, circuit, circumference". There are also numerous bouquets of red roses, one in a vase on a Grecian/Roman column. Because of the film's controversy, original NC-17 versions of the film have been released in the United States. We have the same kitchen area with the bathtub and sink on the right, both with rolled lips, wainscoting on the wall behind, cupboards above. What had been a light blue towel is now a red towel. Bugs Bunny serves the Tazmanian Devil (doubling as Santa Claus in the cartoon) milk and cookies and offers him devil's food cake, just as we have here Alice eating the devil's food cookies and drinking milk. For a few weeks, most of the rep houses in the city were screening Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut… One hundred and fifty? On the side of the blue building we're able to view the large painted sign "Everything Electronic for Less! DOMINO: Don't worry. While looking at mythic associations, it is simply another myth to consider. Alice  says she's going to bed. Kubrick emphasizes this in the next scene, through the movie that Alice is watching. Beneath that line lies a nude woman, legs spread, wearing thigh high red boots, swinging the much smaller Alex figure around by one leg. Yes, he says, the prostitute did die, but her death had nothing to do with him or the party. And how does a hundred and fifty sound? Instead of responding with rage, while in a state of shock, the audience accepts the idea that they are unable to rebel against the experiences of Be Black, Baby! And Alice happens to be eating SnackWells Devil's Food cookies. * * * * * * * * *  179 MS Interior Domino's apartment, Bill and Domino entering. On the TV screen we first see a number of pigeons then a waiter in white jacket and black tie serving a table, the  customer saying "Thank you", the waiter replying  "Prego, prego,"  the man replying, "Grazie." By signing up to receive emails, you agree to receive occasional promotional offers for programs that support The Nation's journalism. It has perhaps instead to do with the switch that happened in 2001 when HAL declared his chess move from Frank Poole's "white" position rather than his own "black" position. 181 MS Alice in the Harford kitchen. Exit only, honey! All rights reserved. If we compare this view to the other non-set view of a city street opening this section, they seem similar because in both, on the left corner of an intersection, we have a brick building which has windows bordered top and bottom with bars of white, then across the intersection in both is a building with a large awning. Domino. Not to mention it's Christmas when the birth of the solar deity is celebrated. Logged in as  The fire escapes above are decorated with lights in such a way it looks like a 7 over a 7, or a 77, or maybe it's a great big 3. Hammers pound nails and as Bill passes the hardware store we briefly see the largest hammer poised as if to hammer a nail into the back of his neck, a visual pun on the Yalie talking about having scars on the back of his neck from the lap dancer, implying her digging her nails into the back of his neck. I am reminded of the several view from the kitchen window paintings about the apartment showing a tree in different seasons. Gayle, at Victor's party, had said she'd half of 5th Avenue in her eye when Bill helped her with a clean handkerchief. Just for fun, I've played with the idea that "Electronics for less", declaring its love, connects Marion with Electra as the lost Pleiade. Bill looks to his right. We notice that there are tribal masks all over the walls. Even the "exit only, honey" can be seen as referring back to the bottle of bear honey on the breakfast table during the cartoon scene. Then he fabricates the identity through which he can enter the life of Judy Bishop for the purpose of his film. (49:11) DOMINO: Yeah. BILL: Well, uh, what do you recommend? No one will bother us. My thoughts on Electra may seem far-fetched. DOMINO: It's a lot nicer in there than it is out here. But he acted as if, and that was psychically almost as good as doing the deed. A visual pun is perhaps had here which plays off the idea of the lap dancer leaving scars on the back of one's neck (presumably from her nails). In other words, something hidden and precious. 			}); Steve BrodnerTwitterSteve Brodner is an award-winning graphic artist/journalist. At the far end of the street is a tricolored building, its first floor painted red, second floor white with a Christmas tree outline in 4 stages, and the upper portion being brick. The inner degrees of an equilateral triangle are each 60. Ad Policy Which was an odd request as in the Hans Christian Anderson story the bird simply sang to the emperor, its music dispelling the faces of death looming, returning him to health. The story begins with Jon Rubin going to take a look at an apartment. Bill is backed by a window but Kubrick does not have the blue radiating the window of Domino's bedroom. He is, however, now on one of the studio set's streets and has just passed a book store, all we are able to see of the sign being "The BO..." but there are books viewed through the windows. Polly is a diminutive of Mary. Venice, California is where everyday life is dealt with and where things go sour for Blume and Nina, they splitting up due his stated one act of infidelity committed while he has a cold--and, simultaneously, his wife, who shares the same cold, meets the man with whom she will become involved after her divorce, a musician (Kris Kristofferson), who comes to her welfare office looking for aid. Sewing thread had been resting on what was perhaps a bag of Roz's the prior night as Bill and Alice said goodbye to their daughter and the babysitter on their way out. The plot of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is a variation on all this. Then, later, prior Bill's collision with the bullies, the feline had been raised again via the Pink Pussycat. In any other movie, Jon would likely fall in love with Judy Bishop and then be faced with her discovering that their meeting was artificially staged, that he had been initially using her. It was difficult for me to grab some photos of Jon Rubin's apartment from Hi, Mom! Bill certainly does speak with one "bird", Nick Nightingale. It's okay. In order to comment, you must be logged in as a paid subscriber. This is out of the ordinary. As they reach the door another woman passes in front of the camera who wears a hat similar to Domino's, which is a Russian fur style hat.  Cut to the prostitute reclining on her bed, a stuffed tiger in the background (we will see a number of stuffed tigers in the final scene of the movie at the toy store where Bill discusses the possible meaning of his experiences). As it turns out, understanding the meaning behind all of those masks might unlock the secret to understanding the entire movie. Christmas cards hang on the walls. in which De Niro plays Jon Rubin, a Vietnam vet. The street number is 271. In Blume in Love, as Segal states, "If I was Italian he would have answered me in Italian", the camera pans right over a young blond man who had been eyed earlier, during a monologue by Segal on love, by a much older man, and had spurned his glance, the scene an obvious reference to Death in Venice in which a composer goes to Venice and falls in love with a preteen boy, who also represents the composer's desire for his own lost youth. The woman wears a white plush coat and red leggings. DOMINO (giggles, as if disbelieving): What do I recommend? 177 MS Domino and Bill on the corner beside the hardware store. 								  His plan is to make a movie based on what he sees going on in the daily lives of the individuals in those apartments, voyeuristically filming them. In Hi, Mom! I'm thinking out loud when I mention Lot, just showing how I consider different things and some of the reasons why.
