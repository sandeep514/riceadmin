Taizong, too, first attempted a diplomatic solution. <br> <br>18 Song Minqiu 宋敏求, Tang da zhaoling ji 唐大詔令集 (Beijing: Shangwu yinshu guan 1959) 11: 67. This office gave him control over the civil and military affairs of the state. 43 ZZTJ 197: 6207; parallel version XTS 220: 6189. 10 Wechsler, ‘T’ai-Tsung (r. 626–49) the Consolidator,’ pp.189 and 191. [13] Yodong-sŏng 遼東 proved to be a tougher nut to crack. <br> <br>[51] A Tang officer was executed after making a critical error in the siege of Ansi, and the Prince of Jiangxia was only spared the same fate because of substantial merits earlier in the campaign. The bravery of Yang and his small Ansi Fortress, which led to improbable triumph, is what attracted more than five million people to march to theaters to watch the mega-budget period epic “The Great Battle,” directed by Kim Kwang-sik, which opened in September. <br> <br>Fenghuangcheng, or Phoenix Fortress, 鳳凰城 (also Feng fortress 鳳城, modern Fengcheng 鳳城, Jilin) was long associated with the site of Ansi.  In 643 AD, the Goguryeo attacked Silla who then appealed to the Chinese emperor for help. In this way, he may well have hoped to recapture something of the camaraderie among the soldiers which he had experienced in the early days of the Tang’s bid for power. In 642, Yeon Gaesomun killed King Yeongnyu and seized military control over the country. In 645, Taizong launched one of a series of massive winter attacks on Goguryeo. All but one of Taizong’s advisors vehemently opposed his personally leading the army, but he disregarded their counsel. Smith Essays on T’ang Society: The Interplay of Social, Political and Economical Forces (Leiden: Brill, 1976). 		Aliases 87 Now preserved in Wŏljŏng manp’il or Wŏljŏng mannok, see note 72. Taizong eventually ordered the construction of a large earthen siege ramp, which Yang instead captured and used as part of his defense. On the return journey, the Tang army was caught in a severe blizzard, which killed numerous soldiers before they reached Yingzhou 營州 (mod. [32] In the light of these general ideas that come to the fore in the Zizhi tongjian it is somewhat surprising that Sima Guang does not have a separate editorial comment on the 645 campaign: the venture waisted precious resources, achieved little of lasting endurance, and put the imperial enterprise at risk thanks to Taizong’s personal presence as leader of the expeditionary force. Howard Wechsler pointed out that the idealised portrayal of the Zhenguan period was influenced by two factors. [65], When Wei died, Taizong personally composed the text for the epitaph, a very high honour. Sim Kwangse’s initial offering was the trigger for a number of poems of the same akpu genre with the title ‘Sŏngsang pae’ in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 30 Twitchett, The Writing of Official Historiography under the T’ang, pp.128–29. 27 Michael C. Rogers, The Chronicle of Fu Chien: A Case of Exemplar History, (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1968), pp.3–4, pp.40–51. The fortress resides on the Tang forces' march to the capital of Pyongyang. <br> <br>After a lengthy siege and repeated unsuccessful attempts to storm the fortress, Yeon was forced to withdraw and allow Yang to keep his position as fortress commander. In their writings, ranging from editorial comments in histories to poetry, they focus strongly on the siege of Ansi 安市 (Chin. They had decided to attack Ansi and invaded the fortress on 20 June.  Thomas H.C. Lee, The New and the Multiple: Sung Senses of the Past (Hong Kong: The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2004); Mark Strange, ‘A Reading of Hou Jing’s Rebellion in Zizhi Tongjian (Comprehensive Mirror to Aid Government): The Construction of Sima Guang’s Imperial Vision,’ in ed. The first one is inserted into the narrative at the end of the fourth year of King Pojang 寶藏 (645), that is, immediately after Taizong’s return from the Liaodong campaign. Yet he hesitated: it would be improper to undertake military action during the period of mourning for the king, and the emperor was still not prepared to burden the people of Shandong. Yang is sometimes credited with saving the kingdom by his successful defense against Tang Taizong. The defeated emperor riding off into the sunset appeared again a few years later, in Ch’oe Yŏn’s 崔演 (1503–49) poem ‘Chup’ilsan yugam’ 駐蹕山有感), written during his mission to China in 1548. 18 BC – AD 660) and Silla (trad. However, they had been defeated by Tang and surrendered. 	 (vol. 	Geography[1] <br> 64 This will be dealt with in more detail later in this paper. Although he pardoned many enemy officers and soldiers after the battle of Chup’il Hill, he punished more than three thousand Malgal enemy warriors by having them buried alive.  91 See, for instance, the thread ‘Yang Manch’un in History’ on the ‘Chicago Korean Drama Fan Club’ website, where history and fiction are freely mixed together. ZZTJ 197: 6220 gives Bishacheng 卑沙城. The early years of Taizong’s reign were characterised by an atmosphere of openness. Yi Saek described it in another poem as a bleak and desolate (sojo 蕭條) location. He freed the inhabitants of the newly created prefectures of Liao 遼, Gai 蓋 and Yan 巖 (from the conquered fortresses of Yodong, Kaemok and Paegam respectively), who were destined to become slaves as rewards for the Tang officers, and as before Taizong provided the soldiers with rewards from the imperial treasury.[50]. Despite its siege of Ansi, the Tang army was unable to force its capitulation. He explained how he was introduced to this new piece of information through a Ming officer who came to Chosŏn in the wake of the first Japanese invasion of the Imjin war (1592–98). You should attack Geonan first, and once Geonan falls, Ansi will be in our belly. 38 Song Minqiu, Tang da zhaoling ji, 13: 703. [47] When, shortly thereafter, Koguryŏ’s reinforcements were defeated in the battle of Ch’upil Hill near Ansi, the majority of the troops was sent back to P’yŏngyang, while the 3,500 commanding officers were to be taken back to Tang China and given military ranks. Later authors were less inclined to accept this claim.  70 Xiong Zhonggu, Tangshu zhizhuan tongsu yanyi, juan 8, chapter 83 (in Guben xiaoshuo congkan Vol.4.2 (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju), p.745). <br> <br>The Siege of Ansi was a battle between Goguryeo and Tang forces in the Korean peninsula and a part of First campaign in the Goguryeo–Tang War. In the spring of the 645, the vanguard reached Koguryŏ’s territory. The Collected works of Master Dongchundang (동춘당선생별집, 同春堂先生別集) by Song Jungil (송준길, 宋浚吉), first compiled in 1768, includes the passage: "Someone asked, 'What was the name of the commander of Ansi fortress?' 	 This runs counter to expectations, because in the first half of the dynasty many officials vociferously opposed territorial expansion through military means. Although there had always been a close connection between politics and historiography, the two became institutionally more intertwined from the early Tang period. It will be more secure to first capture Ansi and Geonan, and then march deep into Goguryeo territory. Meanwhile, Emperor Taizong of Tang joined the forces and they captured Yodong and Baegam one after another. The biography of Fu Jian 苻堅 (r. 357–85) of the Former Qin 前秦 (351–94) was, argues Rogers, manipulated with the specific aim of providing a cautionary example for Tang Taizong. Yet they could not deny there were problems with this image. Meanwhile, Li Daozong was building a dirt mound to the southeast of the city to use as an attack mechanism, and in response, the Ansi defenders added to the height of the wall to the southeast. If you move your army against Ogol instead, it will fall the day that you arrive there, and then all of the cities on the way to Pyongyang will crumble as well. Finally, after four months, Taizong lifted the siege on 15 November 645, because supplies were running low, and the bitter winter was approaching. Thus he suggested the use of non-Han troops such as Khitan and Malgal. 	 The commander of Ansi’s observation of ritual propriety as the imperial host broke off the siege, spoke to the imagination of many Chosŏn literati. [1], On 1 April 645, Spearheads of Tang forces led by Li Shiji pretended to march to camp Huaiyuan and suddenly started to invade Goguryeo.  The Goguryeo controlled an area that covered the north part of the Korean Peninsula, most of Liaoyang and Jilin province in modern China and part of what is now Primorsky Krai in Russia. Sui Yangdi was cast as the stereotypical bad last ruler of a dynasty; his relentless efforts to conquer Koguryŏ were considered part of the cause of the dynasty’s downfall. [72] Yun Kŭnsu refers to this event a second time in a preface (sŏ, Chin. Yang Manchun is the name given to the Goguryeo commander of Ansi Fortress in the 640s. XTS 220: 6193 says they were ‘executed’ (zhu 誅).  25 For more information on this process, see Denis Twitchett, The Writing of Official Historiography under the T’ang (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp.5–30. 7 In addition to Jack Chen’s own monograph and the works he mentions in note 1, p.13, see also Arthur Wright, ‘T’ang T’ai-tsung: The Man and the Persona,’ in eds J.C. Perry and B.L. The final paragraph of Taizong’s ‘Benji’ 本紀 in the Xin Tangshu contains the Appraisal (Zan 贊) of the historian. Encompassing nearly every industry, the … This is, like the Art of War stated, "Some cities do not need to be attacked. With one simple comparison between the two men, Kim elevates the anonymous commander of Ansi to a level as equally deserving of historical fame as Tang Taizong himself. as Sa-mool, Taehak-do Head. In a short prefatory note to his akpu (Chin. 14 Xue Rengui’s exploits in Liaodong became fictionalised, see for instance the anonymous Qing-dynasty novel Rengui zheng dong 薛仁貴征東. <br> <br>[39] Taizong also personally provided medical care for three of his officers wounded during the campaign, an act which combines a gesture of compassion with the companionship he sought among his fellow officers.[40]. <br> <br>77 Sim Kwangse, ‘Sŏngsang pae’, in Hyu-ong jip 休翁集 3: 6b–7. Taizong made amends and ordered the headstone be restored, and provided Wei’s family with a stipend.[66].  	 <br> <br><http://deiner.proboards.com/thread/6407>. 76 Kim Siyang, Pugye kimun  涪溪記聞, in Taedong yasŭng Vol.13, p.534.
