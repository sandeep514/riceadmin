After Steve leaves on an ocean liner without Torchy, she decides to parachute into the ocean, forcing the ocean liner to rescue her. Fast talking caper flick with a couple fighting constantly as they try to solve a crime. Movies. And while Lane’s banter is on point, the romantic banter between she and Paul Kelly doesn’t work, which again, means a crucial element in the formula is off base. Although Lola Lane is a talented performer, she was an odd choice to take over as Torchy and not just because she’s a brunette. 				Change ), You are commenting using your Google account. Torchy follows the trail and pieces together that the stolen cash will need be exchanged, otherwise it will be simple for the police to track the bills. Steve McBride. 				 Made by fans in Auckland, New Zealand. I think she handles the rapid fire banter well enough, but it just isn’t the same, a very good performance, but she just can’t keep pace with Farrell’s watermark. Apparently this is one in a series of whimsical mystery-adventures; and the only one to star the incredibly named Lola Lane as the title character.

Torchy has become fashion-conscious in this edition, a rather odd departure for the character. A watchable if a bit obvious mystery with quite a few interesting quirks that is hampered by the recasting of Torchy and Steve for this episode. </p> <p>Honestly, the movie itself isn't bad.

Synopsis Torchy, Steve, and Gahagan are on the trail of a bank robber aboard an ocean liner traveling from New York to L.A. via the Panama Canal. 					Directed by William Clemens. 					 The story is also subpar with the mystery tipped early on. The focus veers off of Torchy too often and the problem is magnified because the shift to following the prominent male characters is a poor one. </p> <p>Decent, but it’s missing the spark that Glenda Farrell brought to the Torchy character.

Show All… For the film version, Kennedy is changed to a woman named "Torchy" Blane and is now in love with MacBride's character. Torchy has some great fashions but other than that the movie is pretty unremarkable. Taking over for Barton MacLane, Paul Kelly starts out too serious, with his character’s playful jousting with Torchy sounding ominous. Soon enough, Torchy, her boyfriend Steve (Paul Kelly), Gahagan and his lodge crew, and perhaps the thief are bound for Panama, where Torchy is convinced the hand off will be made. The cast also includes Tom Kennedy, Betty Compson, and Hugh O’Connell. </p> <p>marcfusion.com/2019/10/02/torchy-blane-in-panama-1938/.

The whole film is terrific, in fact; just an adorable and fun romp that's utterly meaningless yet brimming with charm. 					 I also like that Torchy has some grand moments, including a parachute jump, but this Panama adventure is more fizzle than spark. The narrative is fine, with a light murder mystery and some broad humor, though this one seems a little more mean spirited, rather than light and brisk. Torchy, Steve and Gahagan follow a bank robber by boat to panama. The "Collection Name" is in the notes. Still it's no His Girl Friday. Determined to scoop the other newspapers, Torchy convinces Steve that the perpetrator of the recent bank robbery will travel with the Los Angeles delegation of Leopards through the Panama Canal and exchange the stolen money outside the country. Steve spots her wet clothes drying on Stan's balcony and breaks in, shooting him. Moments after Steve arrives at the bank, reporter Torchy Blane (Lola Lane), Steve's girlfriend, arrives and does her own investigating. Entertainment Value: This fifth volume of Torchy Blane’s adventures marks a severe departure on several fronts, not the least of which is the replacement of Glenda Farrell and Barton MacLane in the lead roles. Fortunately, Tom Kennedy returns as the lunkheaded Gahagan and Paul Kelly is serviceable as Torchy's love interest, Steve McBride. Honestly, I missed Glenda & Barton too much to enjoy this one 100%, but Torchy Blane in Panama (1938) can definitely be entertaining. As soon as the ship docks at the other end of the Canal, Steve flies back to look for Torchy. Even though lawman Gahagan (Tom Kennedy) and a group of his lodge buddies were in the area, the heist has baffled the authorities. But ever curious reporter Torchy Blane (Lola Lane) is on the case and with seventy thousand dollars in the take, there are bound to be some clues.

The replacements, Lola Lane and Paul Kelly are actually decent, they have some chemistry and Lola Lane playing a girl reporter is fun for the superman fan in me and i'm a sucker for a 30s girl reporter movie anyway, but it's very hard to replace Glenda Farrell in particular and some of the quicker lines seem to be written for her and fall a little flat without her. And he looks great in a leopard suit. "Well if it isn't Miss Blane of The Star, and all wet too, just like your story!". Gahagan is in the lodge. With that said, for the most part this is an okay film that clocks in at just a hour so it flies by pretty good. Soon enough, Torchy, her boyfriend Steve (Paul Kelly), Gahagan and his lodge crew, and perhaps the thief are bound for Panama, where Torchy is convinced the hand off will be made. TORCHY BLANE IN PANAMA was a disappointment when originally released so Warner brought back the original stars for the next installment. marcfusion.com 					 On board, she ignores Steve and talks to all the Leopards, trying to identify the thief.
