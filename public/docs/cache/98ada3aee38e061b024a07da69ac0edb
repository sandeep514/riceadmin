For all practical purposes 	  “The weight becomes the big problem,” Jiro explains to his colleagues, “One solution would be… we could leave out the guns. During the journey, he meets Naoko, a young girl traveling with her maid, for the first time. I don’t know. 		 However, when Jiro proposes to Naoko, she refuses, saying that she was inflicted with tuberculosis. 					 The engagement scene is The Wind Rises‘ most cringe-worthy, setting off alarm bells from the moment the audience sees that Jiro’s confession of love isn’t even directed at Naoko. Sheâs also totally game for marriage. Hayao Miyazaki’s 2013 Studio Ghibli film, The Wind Rises, is based on the true story of Jiro Horikoshi, a Japanese aviation engineer behind World War II’s Zero warplane. What other binding does Miyazaki accomplish through her? That, I assume, is because it's about an amazing and enigmatic bit of animation. Meanwhile, thorugh Jiro’s eyes Miyazaki shows us the contradictions in Japan’s ambition to catch up with the West in modern military technology while its people were suffering from the excruciating poverty. [11], Miyazaki was inspired to make the film after reading a quote from Horikoshi: "All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful".[12]. In 1959 he made Hiroshima Mon Amour, a love story between a French actress and a Japanese architect. Interest-Based Ads.  			 In light of that, The Wind Rises may also be something of a tribute to Mrs. Miyazaki, and an admission of guilt by Miyazaki for not being there for her.So I don't think we should look at Jiro's marriage to Naoko in a bad light.  In the sanatorium, he converses with a variety of characters with different philosophies and backgrounds, from a Dutch Dionysian to a Jesuit Marxist. 		 Like Miyazaki, the real Horikoshi criticized his nation’s part in war, believing the country’s leaders had doomed their people with their role in World War II. A number of critics have remarked that Satomi is not the strong assertive female lead associated with Miyazaki; she’s not like Nausicaä, Sheeta, Kiki, Fio, or Lady Eboshi, to name only the most obvious examples. The Wind Rises was rereleased last weekend in a version with famous English-speaking voices (Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Horikoshi; Emily Blunt is Naoko), which feels like further dilution. It wasn’t unusual for audiences to arrive at his films and see an anthropomorphic pig piloting an airplane, or children riding a Cat Bus. 	 (In the English-language version released this week in the U.S., Joseph Gordon-Levitt provides Jiro’s voice, while Emily Blunt speaks the role of Naoko.) It’s a movie about dreams and love and beauty and a sense of the afterlife that plays as historical reappraisal. At least one critic – alas, I forget who – noted that this aspect of the film is pure melodrama: beautiful woman, love, coughing blood, doomed marriage. It's really hard to remember films accurately; reviewers make factual mistakes all the time.Yes, I'll read your post. Naoko Satomi is first seen during the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake of Japan on a train travelling with her maid. Continuing his walk with Caproni, Jiro looks to the sky and the wind, taking his wife's words deeply to heart. 	 Naoko Satomi is the deuteragonist of The Wind Rises. churlish to do so. 			 Except that this tragedy never happened to Horikoshi. He started making shorts in the 1930s and is reported to have expired with notes for a new film at his side. The Wind Rises vividly depicts Taisho and Showa Japan from the economic hardships in the 1920s through the rise of militarism in the 1930s. Effectively, the Horikoshi in the film is given the choice between the real Horikoshi’s life within the war, and an alternate, theoretical life outside of it, one more anonymous, but less fraught. Obviously, âI have tuberculosisâ is code for âI will tragically die before the end of this movie,â and so it goes. Jiro expresses his regret and sorrow of the destruction and devastation his "Zero" fighter had caused during the war. How could a career so creative, so combustible, so distinct, have such an anodyne coda? I congratulate you for the great post. He went the opposite direction of most elder statesman: Screw mortality; yes to fun. The Wind Rises still delivers â the dream sequences where Jiro bonds with Italian engineer Giovanni Caproni over the magic of flight pack in all the surreal visuals a Miyazaki fan could want â but itâs hard not to watch without Kikiâs Delivery Service or Ponyo hovering in the back of oneâs mind. She's painting, and we see the painting. However, much to his dismay, his eye-sight deteriorates rapidly, preventing Jiro from ever piloting an aircraft. Thereâs another major difference between The Wind Rises and Miyazakiâs other work, however: itâs completely missing three-dimensional, complex women â precisely the type of character the animator, director, and screenwriter has focused on in the past. But itâs impossible to watch Jiroâs wife gazing adoringly at him as he perfects the Zero without thinking of just how much more fun her predecessors were to watch, or how much of a joy they were to relate to as a kid raised on a steady diet of Disney princesses. As Jiro proudly watches his creation touch down onto the ground, he feels a strong gust of wind from the distant mountains. The past is never dead. Consider the associations emanating from Naoko Satomi: In Timothy Perper and Marthoa Cornog, eds.  Itâs indicative of the way Naokoâs character is treated throughout The Wind Rises: except for the fact that she has a wealthy father and enjoys painting, we know almost nothing about her outside of her relationship with Jiro, a lack of depth thatâs particularly strange given The Wind Risesâ marketing as equal parts fictional biography and love story. A look at the life of Jiro Horikoshi, the man who designed Japanese fighter planes during World War II. In the early 1970s I discovered that “Kubla Khan” had a rich, marvelous, and fantastically symmetrical structure. http://www.villagevoice.com/film/the-trouble-with-the-wind-rises-6440390, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Rises, http://new-savanna.blogspot.com/2015/11/from-concept-to-first-flight-a5m.html, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom, https://www.academia.edu/15502928/Dr._Tezuka_s_Ontology_Laboratory_and_the_Discovery_of_Japan, Mind-Culture Coevolution: Major Transitions in the Development of Human Culture and Society, Twisted and colorful, with a hint of monster, John Collins to judge 6TH annual 3QD philosophy prize. “The Trouble with The Wind Rises”.  May 25-30 is Studio Ghibli Week at Polygon.  Moreover, since Japanese houses were mostly built of wood, fire spread rapidly, burning down 212,000 residences. But you’re lost on Mars! The test goes well. 	Atsushi Okui It seems made by restless ghosts. During this period, Jiro’s romance with Nahoko takes place in the quiet mountains of the Karuizawa resort., A German traveler, Castorp, whose name derives from Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain, describes the quiet mountains as a shelter from the gloomy atmosphere in Japan caused by the invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the withdrawal from the League of Nations in 1933, and the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. It’s an empirical question, and one I don’t know how to answer. A biopic? It doesn't only parallel his parent's lives/roles/relationship, it also parallels Miyazaki's own relationship with his wife. In the movie, Jiro starts out as a young boy living in a provincial town in Japan, who dreams of a day when he could design and possibly fly airplanes. 	 Fascinating! 	 But free as Miyazaki may be to put the spotlight on a male protagonist, that prerogativeâs no excuse for how flat the filmâs female characters turn out to be. "Naoko isn't merely a symbol--she supports Jiro in his quest, and makes choices of her own." I didnât exactly walk into The Wind Rises intending to measure Naoko against Nausicaa. Maybe "emblem" would be better, especially as I've used that word in connection with discussions of Apocalypse Now and "Kubla Khan".You're right about the personal connection between Miyazaki's neglect of his own family and Jiro's neglect of Naoko, for which is sister thrashes him. she’s not a muse), are bound to the design of that plane. The Wind Rises is a movie based on a real historical figure in Japanese history, Jirō Horikoshi, who was responsible for creating the infamous "Zero" fighter during the first years of World War II. Really really lost. But when they were married, she stayed home to raise the kids. Hayao Miyazaki has vowed that The Wind Rises is his last film. It’s the movie of a ferocious animist and part-time surrealist who’s slipping away, leaving his body, moving on to some new ethereal place. Strapping his slide-ruler to the side of her leg, Jiro leads both Naoko and her maid to safety. His aesthetic landed somewhere between surrealism and the lecture hall. But the cherry blossom has a more specific association, one highly pertinent to the film. Matsutoya has collaborated with Studio Ghibli before in the production for Kiki's Delivery Service, which features her songs Rouge no Dengon(ルージュの伝言) and Yasashisa ni Tsutsumaretanara(やさしさに包まれたなら). 	 It puts human faces on a set of big, abstract, messy ethical and personal dilemmas.
