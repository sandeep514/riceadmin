Joan Jan 24 2017 3:09 pm  Liyah Oct 25 2016 10:19 am  To me this is my most favorite Korean drama of all times, this drama teaches you a lot about the real world and how things really works. Watched both seasons numerous times. loadbox(1); ixxdhx81 Aug 26 2016 7:16 pm  peachprincess Jul 23 2016 5:28 am  Hwa Young! The plot of the story is, AT FIRST, confusing, but When you progress through it's actually super good. 			 A second season of JTBC’s sleeper hit drama Age of Youth is in the works for a broadcast later this year, and it’s been announced that there will be some changes in the cast lineup for the sequel. Teana Jan 01 2017 2:53 am  @kayla Been trying to find out who he is, but everywhere says Lee chul woo and its not lee chul woo right? kenchen Aug 29 2016 5:48 am  Lizzie Aug 18 2018 11:32 pm  A year has passed since “Hello, My Twenties 1.” Each of them got a job, went back to school, is still trying to get a boyfriend, or is getting over her first breakup. Great series. Does anyone know who the guy is who plays as Ji won blind date on ep 3??? Nooo i'm gonna miss this drama it's a pity it's underrated, popular dramas don't really appeal to me. I can't wait for the rest of the roller coaster ride. N/A Oct 08 2016 5:27 pm  Maila Ulfa Aug 28 2016 4:12 pm  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1431704070868-0'); }); Current user rating: 89/100 (3398 votes) Park Eun-bin as Song Ji-won the talented, hyperactive journalism major in is very intelligent, fast on her feet , and has a very impressive range of acting - and amazing dancing! She is now returning to her university. This drama is so precious! He appears in a lot of singing contests and variety shows since he's hilarious. Lorena Silva May 05 2017 12:08 pm  It touched my heart and it makes so much sense about our everyday lives. Ye-Eun is devoted to her boyfriend, she is clear about what she likes or not. Hello, My Twenties is a Korean slice of life drama revolving around the lives of five young adults who must navigate the … I am so glad that you're doing great in acting. i love you all belle epouqe’s girls!! If there is going to be a season 3 doesn’t anyone know when it will be released? Yoolbin is Eun Jae first love! PEO Sep 08 2016 10:03 pm  University students Yoon Jin-Myung (Han Ye-Ri), Jung Ye-Eun (Han Seung-Yeon), Song Ji-Won (Park Eun-Bin), Kang Yi-Na (Hwa Young) and Yoo Eun-Jae (Park Hye-Soo) share a house.             			 hope this drama will turn out well. That senpai with the long hair he is not going to show up again?!!! By the way, Kang Yi na and Song Ji won are my favorite characters here, Mia Aug 14 2016 5:39 am  Sunny not take main role hm.. maybe she confused because never play drama i hope sunny take role main cast in another drama and han ye ri i miss her after long time not play drama and focus in movie hope man cast not ajushi again hahahah ye ri eonni faiting, ray Jun 14 2016 6:18 am  Her shy, tentative and barely articulate interactions with her roommates at home and her cool, kind psychology senior Yoon Jong-Yeol (played by Shin Hyun-Soo) are a fun to watch. Furly Pink Jul 18 2017 11:15 am  FaithLoveJ Jul 31 2016 9:10 pm  There is this very calming factor about the realistic aspect of the show, for a second it felt as though I was intruding onto someone else's life. uswa Sep 17 2016 8:32 am  they both act together at healer :), Age of Youth (2016) Jul 23 2016 7:55 am  This drama truly has so much potential. I didn't know it was so good, it literally just brings me to tears in episodes because the characters are well-potrayed. W4GRB.user_rating[1]=0; how can't they just end it like that?! I cried when the drama ended, but thank god Season 2 is coming out in like a month after I finish watching Season 1. I like the story, fighting! Writing from Nigeria. She was scared of looking weak. Each episode has something different. © AsianWiki.com. Rouge Aug 28 2016 10:45 pm  Now i just hope that Eun Jae and her sunbae will still in a cute relationship, cause this two person is my really fave couple X)), JPP May 19 2017 3:34 am  Maya Aug 13 2016 9:30 am  I have been watching it on Netflix and kind of hooked. I hope JTBC will give us all a proper closure by producing the 3rd Season with the original Cast in it: Park hye su as Eun Jae & Ryu hwa Young as Kang Yina and the rest of the crew and ofcourse I hope sunbae Yoon Jong-yeol played by Shin yoon soo will be there as well!!! Especially when Jung Yeeun frustrated because of her boyfriend and almost ruin her life with some bad guy in the night club. One day, a new student arrives at the house with a letter she stumbled upon. A girl who must work hard for earning tuition, a girl who 'sells' herself for glamorous life, a girl who loves her boyfriend a lot, a girl who is single for a long time, and a girl who has the worst problem in the past. Thandy Aug 29 2016 10:50 pm  Age of Youth is one of korean series i been waiting to have another season with the same cast and characters cause they portayed their characters very well to the extent that you can't miss to watch the next episode.... sassyahjumma Mar 19 2017 12:54 am  I also agree with everything @kdrama_junkie has to say below:). Love all the girls but Eun Jae and Ji won are my most favorites. Hopefully there's season 2 with same casts. Great short drama. At first, I like to watch Yoo Eunjae because she is so innocent and cute. Her character brings the protective instinct toward her housemates...like in episode 10...she's willing to pull the hair of ye-eun friend who pass malicious text towards her....with her on the show she brings so much adventure together with the girls... kingstar_88 Oct 18 2017 8:49 am  He looks worried about Yina. W4GRB.query_url=new Array(); This drama will etch itself into your heart. Hello! Thank you for creating this show ! I love every couple! Guys is this drama scary?? I really recommend those who have not watched to support this drama. I'm in love with this drama considering I'm very picky when it comes to k-drama. 			 The story is so simple and realistic, which is I can relate it very well, because I also a college student. I’ve been trying to finish the season 2 for quite sometime already, but still I couldn’t finish because they have alot of screen time. OMG! @mysticai yoon jong hoon. I would love more. Such a lovely drama, i am so into it! @iam thanks so much. Is there anyone know the song which playing when Eun Jae and her sunbae come up? hyehye112 Aug 30 2016 2:40 am  I just finished watching ep1 to 6. kyp Aug 04 2016 9:19 pm  I am totally into this drama... does anyone else know other ost in age of youth?? Awesome movie! Is there going to be a season 3? The problem is all u can see in the real life .. Besides, I also think that Kang Yina's friend, Dongjoo also has a feeling toward Yina.  Ji-Won has a bright personality and likes to drink. ken Aug 02 2016 3:07 pm  Thankyou before. It's has friendship, romance and mystery with realism added to the mix. Kl Aug 05 2016 10:16 pm  She got pregnant. 샤론 Sep 02 2018 4:41 pm  				26 Episodes, Ryu Hwa-young ?love u my Unii's. i am enjoy watch this series W4GRB.average_rating[1]=89; I wanted ji-won to get with a guy :( waiting for season 3 !!! Ryu Hwayoung and Park Eunbin really rock their character so perfectly. Love it! The big exception is the character of Yoo Eun-Jae the very young, shy, innocent, withdrawn and struggling first year woman who is a psychology major. It will definitely leave you feeling so sad that it's over after watching it. The dialogues are often very good and sharp.             			 I miss Belle Epoque. I seriously love this drama. Terru Jun 20 2018 10:32 pm  yx Jul 31 2016 3:30 am  Mb Dec 28 2016 10:11 am  I was too upset about Eun-Jae’s characters being replaced in season 2 and gave up watching, but my curiosity would stay still. I miss this drama:((((( Piopumpum Aug 04 2016 1:44 pm  I have watched both series, The original series is so much better: it is sharp, warm, very human and very enjoyable of the problems of growing up as a modern young woman in today's Korea.. (Watched the first 4 eps so far). Lisbeth Mar 01 2019 6:34 pm  //]]>, //<! And that is how I feel sometimes. @Mysticai his name is Yoon Jong-Hoon. ... i will miss you girls . It's a MUST WATCH!!!! This drama has lot of potential, i love the story, the cast everything JTBC i want a season 2!!!!! So nice to see an array of strong female characters dealing with difficult and comedic situations. Kang Yi Na is a good eonnie for them, even if she have a bad personality. shiney one Sep 10 2016 7:51 am  Ratings are low too well it can't be helped this drama airs on a cable pay TV so it has a relatively smaller audience compared to free-to-air public broadcasters (KBS, SBS, MBC).
