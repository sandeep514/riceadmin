From that point, Cam begins to get weird in ways you really cannot anticipate. For fans of the horror genre, the last decade or so has been one of the richest in history, with fresh instant classics as artistically ambitious as they are deeply disturbing, arriving in theaters every single year. After blowing the doors off the found footage genre with 2010's utterly brilliant Trollhunter, Øvredal returned to land of the creepy for his 2016 followup, The Autopsy of Jane Doe. Of the film's overarching mystery, we'll tell you that the story unfolds in the aftermath of a pandemic event that's eliminated untold numbers of the world's population. Just know that as the film's minor mysteries begin to unravel, a far more grueling picture of humanity unfolds within them. By now, you should be well acquainted with the name Jeremy Saulnier. That has a lot to do with the fact that the cult mentality remains as puzzling as the typically enigmatic figures who front the cults themselves. Set in the hyper-competitive world of online "camgirls," Cam follows a particularly ambitious performer named Alice (Madeline Brewer) who, under the guise of her alter ego Lola_Lola, has risen through the ranks of the camgirl elite. Of It Comes At Night's numerous small-scale mysteries, we'll offer that the film follows a man and his family riding things out in a secluded cabin in the woods, only to find their rigorously structured life upended by the arrival of another family. But while the night kicks off jubilantly, an ominous energy begins to seep through every single moment, and it quickly becomes clear Eden and David have very specific reasons for getting the gang together. They've also dedicated themselves to giving up-and-coming filmmakers a crack at showbiz by producing micro-budget flicks too fringe for the mainstream. All you need to do is change your Netflix™ country. Check out How to Easily Change your Netflix Country for information and step-by-step instructions and videos. What are the best mystery series to watch on Netflix? Just as a teaser, we'll offer that The Endless follows a pair of brothers who, years after breaking free from the "alien death cult" with which they spent much of their youth, are called back into the fold by, well, we're not entirely sure what. Less a proper mystery than a film fueled by one "holy f**k, what's happening here?" While there's seemingly no end to what cinematic treasures one can uncover in the rapidly evolving land of streaming, we can't help but feel that such uncertainty makes it as good a time as ever to dive into a good old fashioned mystery movie. In doing so, he delivers a cleverly observed puzzle box of a film, assembled with the detail-oriented eye of a detective to present a devastating view of the future — even if the film's inherent paradoxical quandaries ultimately crumble under the weight of serious scrutiny. The unofficial guide to the best movies, shows and documentaries that are available on Netflix in the United Kingdom. Though Justin Benson and Aaron Moorehead's 2017 Lovecraftian stunner The Endless takes the enigmatic leader mostly out of the equation, their film remains a no less sinister psychological study of cult mentality — one that happens to be so consumed by abstract supernatural mysteries you're likely to drive yourself batty trying to solve them all. The burgeoning auteur indeed keeps his sophomore film surprisingly compact, utilizing just a single location and three central characters to sow the sinister seeds of a brooding psychological thriller, fueled by a finely-spun fiction bleeding horrifically into real world drama. There's a good chance you haven't even heard of The Interview, so let us tell you two things: it's a first rate crime thriller fueled by a fascinating central mystery, and it features what may be the best performance of Hugo Weaving's career. Though we'd warn you that even the most minor of details in Freaks can have a major impact on the story. A former nurse saves her favorite writer from a blizzard but morphs from nurturer to sadistic jailer when she learns he plans to kill off her heroine. The best action and adventure series on Netflix, The best family and kids series on Netflix, The best sci-fi & fantasy series on Netflix. Flixboss solves That's as true of the major twists as it is of the seemingly minor ones as well. With any luck the director's subtle yet savagely tense thriller Everybody Knows will change that. what's good and it's easy to waste a lot of time trying to find something to watch. Please trust us that it's worth the wait. The moment Lily moves into the house, unsettling events begin to occur that may or may not be tied to the macabre narrative of the writer's most famous book. All Rights Reserved. Sometimes, however, the mystery is merely a tool used to set in motion a far more ambitious narrative. Here are the best mystery shows streaming now on Netflix. After being trapped by Lockhart, the fiercely motivated killer (Cleopatra Coleman) shockingly reveals intimate details of Lockhart's life. After the death of his father, they decide to open a hotel. Check out the recent additions below or use the IMDb toggle to sort by rating. Thrills aside, Farhadi takes the slow-burn approach with Everybody Knows, using the first 30 minutes of the film — which follows a family gathering for a wedding — to build an intricately constructed house of cards around the inter-familial relationships. In short: it's an improved search engine for Netflix. In turn, The Interview unravels into a daring cat and mouse game that has as much in common with The Usual Suspects as the work of Agatha Christie. Just FYI — we're sort of living in a golden age of Sherlock Holmes adaptations, with the famed detective appearing in beloved big and small screen ventures alike. Along the way, Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem also deliver two of their finest performances to date. We freely admit that we might be slightly bending the strictest definition of "mystery movie" with the inclusion of Netflix's full-throttle actioner Wheelman on this list, because plot isn't really the point of the film. And the good news is, there are mysteries-a-plenty just begging to be discovered on Netflix. available on Netflix in the United Kingdom. It'll leave you questioning how much of yourself you actually want to put into the world via the internet. Like the best horror mysteries, answers only raise more questions in The Autopsy of Jane Doe as the film ominously propels itself toward a shockingly sinister finale as thrilling as it is terrifying. When their therapist (Ted Danson) recommends a weekend away at a posh, secluded estate, the desperate duo jump at the chance to rekindle the romantic fires. Still, few of those movies have been brave enough to tackle the mysteries of the afterlife as directly as Charlie McDowell's The Discovery. Part bracing chamber drama and part tightly-wound psychological thriller, The Invitation follows the story of Will (Logan Marshall-Green), who's accepted an invitation for himself and his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) to attend a dinner party at the home of his ex-wife, Eden (Tammy Blanchard), and her new husband, David (Michael Huisman). Cookies help us deliver our Services. Enola is finally getting her cinematic moment in the sun via a crackling Netflix adaptation featuring Stranger Things breakout Millie Bobby Brown. Her name is Enola. In the wake of the disappearance, deep dark secrets begin to find the light, and Everybody Knows becomes that rarest of mysteries whose tightly wound narrative unfurls with Shakespearean weight. Stick with it, because when Session 9 pulls the rug out from under you, it does so in a way that'll leave your head spinning for days after. Set almost entirely inside the confines of the man's car, and told with a breathless sense of urgency, Wheelman's mysteries unfold with a steady hand, an unapologetic tough guy's acting tough aesthetic, and an insatiable appetite for anarchy. Equal parts psychological thriller and haunted house chiller, Session 9 so effectively shrouds its narrative in mystery that some viewers might find themselves as lost in the story's sallow exploration of soul-decaying trauma as the characters trapped within. Once you've gotten caught up on Saulnier's wildly original, beyond tense cinematic style, stick around Netflix for a little longer and treat yourself to the director's latest beastly brooder, Hold the Dark. For many films that dabble in enigmatic thrills and moral conundrums, the mystery is the whole point of the story.
