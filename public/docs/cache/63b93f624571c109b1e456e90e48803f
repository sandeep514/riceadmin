How Their Character Left: Tried for murder in the Season 9 finale, Lake went free after his actions were ruled as self-defense. Entertainment Television, LLC A Division of NBCUniversal. <br> Leaving at the last minute, his character was given a quick write off after Season 12. But to the surprise of viewers at the end of the episode, series regular Detective Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) broke the news to his partner Detective Benson (Mariska Hargitay) that he was leaving the force to move out West. Also versed in Large Scale Aggressors, time travel, and Guillermo del Toro. Having just survived a near fatal gunshot wound or two, Detective Amaro seemed pretty insistent on transferring out of the unit that offered little in terms of promotions. After a shootout in the courtroom that saw him take out Johnny D. (Charles Halford), Benson's (Mariska Hargitay) latest tormentor, Amaro took a bullet to the liver and knee. One possible opportunity is that Pino may become a cast regular on a show he’s guested on recently, “Chicago P.D.” He played the same character, Detective Amaro, in two episodes in 2014-5. Check out the hottest fashion, photos, movies and TV shows! TVLine confirmed that Pino will not return for Season 17 of “Law & Order: SVU,” but his character didn’t die in the line of fire. The actor said farewell to the show in the Season 16 finale, but does it mean he's done with his character Detective Amaro for good? Though in her reasoning, she did speculate that a long break might let her return, and as you see with her recurring history with the series, it certainly did. Through his Twitter account, Danny Pino thanked his fans and SVU cast and crew for the past four seasons: Thank u @nbcsvu @WolfFilms cast, writers, directors, guest casts, crew, editors for 4 fantastic seasons. A Vietnam Vet with the typical hard nose that comes from working in the NYPD (as well as being a Mets fan), Captain Donald Cragen is the sort of guy that’d back his detectives, no matter the cost. Which only led to be arrested again for murdering a suspect he believed to be guilty, but was released by a jury deadlock. ), CLICK: The best and worst ways actors have left TV shows. and Chicago Medical. Her final reason for departure saw a now-retired Alexandra helping battered women “disappear” from their abusive homes. Danny Pino Leaving Law and Order: SVU Find out how the character left the show. <br> <br>This paved the way for one of many returns by Stephanie March’s ADA Alexandra Cabot. Why The Actor Left: The reasoning behind Danny Pino’s departure from Law and Order: SVU wasn’t really explained, other than the fact he was written off the show rather abruptly. Then there's always the possibility that it's the person who wants it the least. Phillip Winchester announced that he was sadly not returning, but gave no further comment as to why. Initially a more … Grateful for all the #SVUDieHards," Pino tweeted after the finale aired. Winchester’s “the facts don’t care about your feelings” prosecutor even had his own series, the short-lived Chicago Justice, which was cancelled after one season, and left him to drift in the Chicago universe, before heading to SVU. Though she had been known to have a more compassionate side, which may have been part of her decision to leave after the prosecution of a pediatrician led to his eventual murder. Why The Actor Left: Michelle Hurd’s short time in the early years of Law and Order: SVU history was marred by the belief that her character wasn’t properly used in the show’s cast. We’ll see where those most recent efforts lead, as the series is back, baby, and doesn't look like it's going anywhere. <br> <br>Although not quite California, a transfer from department to department isn’t out-of-line. A firm believer in the core tenets of the series she inhabits, Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cabot bent her moral code from time to time, but was always an advocate for those victims that that Law and Order: SVU would move to protect. 7 Questions We Have After Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous Season 1, All The Haunting Of Bly Manor Ghosts Explained, Why Brad Pitt Is A Touchstone For Game Of Thrones’ Joe Dempsie When Fame Gets Weird, How Dylan O’Brien’s Impeccable Social Network Parody Came Together, 13 Great Horror Movies To Stream On Amazon Prime Video - October 2020, Armie Hammer, Lily James | Netflix's Rebecca Interviews, Ken Jeong, Phillipa Soo, Margaret Cho And More Talk Netflix's Over The Moon, Kevin James, Noah Schnapp, Maya Rudolph, Tim Meadows & More | Hubie Halloween Interview, Another Week, Another Flick Chock-Full Of A-Listers Has Cracked Netflix's Top 10, Dune’s Timothee Chalamet Has Set The Record Straight On Those Viral Makeout Photos With Lily-Rose Depp, Has Real Steel’s Netflix Success Sparked New Sequel Hope?

News has confirmed Pino, who joined the show in season 13 alongside Kelli Giddish as new detectives replacing Christopher Meloni, left the series as a series regular as of the season 16 finale. Entering its landmark 21st season of crime-stopping, Law and Order: SVU is only going to keep introducing new cast members, and taking some out of the lineup to promote new and exciting paths for the series’ future. Season 20’s “Endgame” saw leaving Law And Order: SVU because he knowingly fixed the case against this man, in the name of his friendship with Lieutenant Olivia Benson. But why the sudden move? Or maybe it's just the person who wants it the most, that's who ends up stepping up to the plate. Why The Actor Left: The showrunner during this era, Neal Baer, felt that including Detective Chester Lake took away from the core cast that made Law and Order: SVU the hit that it was. For a number of reasons, we’ve seen characters come and go from the Law and Order: SVU stable, and we’re about to uncover the details of why they left. Law and Order: SVU returns for its season 17 this fall. Though, when the occasion called for it, Munch did come back a couple of times to lend an assist.

Known to sabotage -- or in some cases deny due process -- to a defendant, it’s a miracle she became the longest-running female ADA in SVU history. A lot of actors have come and gone from the soon to be longest running drama on network TV, and these are their stories. He knew how to get into trouble, both on and off the job, but never knowingly put his partner, Detective Olivia Benson, in harm’s way. Two trips in and out of witness relocation began Cabot’s history of disappearing and reappearing more times than a magician’s rabbit. However, there were unconfirmed rumors she was fired, and Neal never confirmed or denied said rumors. Why The Actor Left: Dann Florek was written out of Law and Order: SVU after Season 15, more than likely due to his character being in a similar age bracket as Richard Belzer’s John Munch. Why The Actor Left: Raul Esparza’s departure from Law and Order: SVU was devoid of drama, as the man himself chose to exit his post in a way similar to that of his character. Amicability reigned, and Florek returned for a guest spot the next season. A former mixed martial artist, Lake eventually became a bit of a vigilante in his tenure as a Law and Order: SVU character, leading to his departure. According to showrunner Warren Leight, writing Amaro off the show happened as the result of both the character and the actor. Actually, I think sometimes the best person is the one you least expect," Hargitay told us prior to the finale. His co-star Mariska Hargitay wished Pino a fond farewell on Twitter: #FriendsForLife pic.twitter.com/9rV9hZ7Vgx.

After disconnecting a comatose infant from its life support system, what he felt was an act of mercy, Barba was tried and acquitted; but after 21 years, he felt it was time to hang it up. Danny Pino, a regular on a slew of cop shows from “The Shield” to “Cold Case,” made the jump to the long running “Law & Order: SVU” cast in … How Their Character Left: Just as quickly as ADA Kim Greylek transferred to Law and Order: SVU, she was called back to Washington D.C. to rejoin the ranks of the Justice Department.
