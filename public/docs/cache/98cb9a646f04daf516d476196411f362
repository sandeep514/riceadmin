That night, Courtney, Dylan, and Clint are hung up on crosses like in the film's intro. Courtney and Dylan invite So & So to stay for the night. Milo says it's fine, and that the videos weren't meant for him. So & So goes to the church home to burn it down, as he's been doing to the other houses in connection to the murders (including the Oswalt home), only to stop when he finds the Collins family there. Each of them have bags over their heads, and someone is filming this.

Stromberg says the girl was telling her that Bughuul couldn't hear her playing over the sound of the mother's screams. Deputy "So & So" (James Ransone) visits a church to talk to a priest regarding what he encountered in the last movie and what happened to the Oswalt family. Stromberg shows him a ham radio that has a recording of a Norwegian girl speaking to her mom while playing the piano, and the mother can be heard screaming in terror. Dylan Collins (Robert Daniel … As they leave, the man calls someone and says, "Yeah, it's definitely her.". Send your questions or comments about this or any other spoiler to: THEMOVIESPOILER.com. Dylan watches another video, this time of a family being tied in their kitchen, sitting in a pool of water, and then electrocuted. That night, Dylan has violent nightmares about more murders. Zach films them and burns Clint to death. There is nothing left out and even the individual death films made by the murder children are described and detailed. So & So advises Courtney not to leave because she would be deemed a flight risk, but he also wants to prevent her and the boys from getting murdered since the same thing happened to the Oswalts. Zach becomes envious of Dylan, claiming he can see the children too. They show him a video of a family on Christmas morning, enjoying the day together, only to get buried alive in the snow and be frozen to death. ‘I Don’t Think Anybody Can Be Confident,’ Says Patty Jenkins, AMC Offers Private Movie Theater Rentals Starting at $99, ‘On My Block’ Actor Danny Ramirez Joins ‘Falcon & the Winter Soldier’, ‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Renewed for Season 4 at CBS All Access, You Season 3 Just Added 2 New Cast Members, Dexter Revival Won't 'Undo Anything,' But It Will Make Things 'Right,' Says EP, John Legend Shares Love And Admiration For Chrissy Teigen After Dedicating BBMAs Performance To Her Following Baby Loss, ‘Saturday Night Live’ Lampoons Trump And Biden’s ‘Duelling Town Halls’ In Political Cold Open, My Music Moments: Miles Brown Shares the Soundtrack to His Life, The Best Stores to Buy Cute College Apparel, ‘Saturday Night Live’: Jim Carrey and Alec Baldwin Take on Dueling Town Halls, Sacha Baron Cohen Lived in Character for Five Days While Filming ‘Borat’ Sequel, ‘Borat 2’: Sacha Baron Cohen Wants To “Reveal The Dangerous Slide To Authoritarianism”, Steven Soderbergh Says HBO Max’s ‘Let Them All Talk’ Will Come Out In December, Dardenne Brothers Give Emotional Speech at Lumière Fest: ‘Coronavirus Is Not Responsible for Everything’. Clint returns with a custody warrant and forces Courtney to give up the boys and return home with him. So & So holds them off by calling their bluff when he sees they don't have a warrant to be there, and if they arrest So & So, it'll draw unwanted media attention since he was previously arrested years back, and he could twist it into a child kidnapping case. He goes through the darkened halls and sees a goblet moving. So & So meets with Dr. Stromberg (Tate Ellington) to discuss what he knows about the murders. She runs outside with Dylan and So & So, where she breaks down and cries for Zach. Zach follows the three into the house with a sickle. Dylan Collins (Robert Daniel Sloan) is lying in bed, looking a bit spooked. Milo tells Dylan that he has to watch all the videos to get the nightmares to stop. The troopers leave, but Clint vows to return. So & So then flashes his light and sees the shadows of children, followed by a brief glimpse of Bughuul.

The cameraperson takes a lighter and drops it on the ground, igniting a fire that burns all three people alive. He starts to decompose and turn into a skeleton, which is projected on a screen upstairs that Courtney sees before the whole house catches fire.

However, after much running and chasing around, the deputy finds Zach and snatches away the camera from his hand, crushing it with a stomp, which ends the cycle. Courtney thinks he's working with the man from the supermarket, and she's even less pleased to hear he's a private investigator, thinking her ex-husband sent him to get the boys back. Zach gets Dylan outside the house and viciously beats him up until he admits that Zach is better. NOTE: This spoiler was submitted by Jeremy. Dylan suffers from horrifying nightmares, making him go to the basement and seek help from a group of children belonging to the demon Bughuul (Nicholas King). The family has moved into a new home that used to be a church where a family was brutally murdered. He forcefully shoves mashed potatoes into Dylan's mouth before apologizing. The main boy, Milo (Lucas Jade Zumann), guides Milo and shows him a home video that one of the other children made.

The film starts with three people hung up on crosses in a cornfield. The two boys play with toy guns, and Zach gets defensive when Dylan "kills" him despite Zach claiming to have already done so to his brother. So & So is investigating the string of murders that the Oswalts became part of. The ending of Sinister is obscure and does not provide ample answers to what Bughuul is, exactly, or what actually happened to Ashley. Zach is now being groomed by Bughuul's children. He films the family outside as they have a picnic. The last video Dylan watches is from Milo, and it takes place in the church. Courtney spots a suspicious-looking man eyeing her and her boys. Dylan is too horrified to watch these videos, despite Milo's insistence to watch another. The demon appears and places his hand on Zach's shoulder. She feels he is following them and she tells the boys to run. He takes the children. Zach continues feeling resentment toward Dylan, calling him a pussy. On his computer screen appear flashes of the church murder, and pictures of Dylan, followed by a red symbol belonging to Bughuul. Zach tries to film the murders again, but So & So breaks the camera. The ham radio he took starts picking up a frequency. So & So tries contacting Courtney and even arrives at Clint's home. Deputy...Deputy..." Bughuul then pops out to deliver one last scare. For a brief moment, he feels the presence of a demonic-looking child lying behind him. Their fate is not straightforward at the end because it was sprinkled throughout the film. The man grabs his rifle and starts beating So & So before telling him that if he ever contacts Courtney again, he'll take it out on her and then kill So & So. Before he can proceed with the other two, So & So arrives and slams Zach with his car. Sinister 2 ending explained During the climax of the film, the ghost children decide to support Zach and help him find where the family is hiding. Milo gathered the rats and laid them on the family's stomachs and covered them with goblets before placing hot coals on each of them to get the rats to eat through the family's bodies and make them bleed out. She does so, and they all have dinner at Clint's home. The laptop turns off, and Bughuul appears in the shadows behind So & So. So & So says he only wants to investigate the property, which Courtney lets him do. He hasn't been on the force since the murders, and he believes there is a demonic presence at work, and he wants to find whatever help he can get in preventing anyone else from suffering the same fate.
