</html>";s:4:"text";s:6708:"On social media, audio from the director's commentary has been making the rounds, with the assumption being that Fincher clashed with Affleck during production. I dont hate Ben, I know hes a stupid kid, so we have to take care of him. Willard forms unhealthy connections to the rats, naming a white rat he’s fond of Socrates, and another more aggressive black rat Ben. He was about as useful as shampoo for a bald man. Hard to begrudge a kid (even if he is a teenager) for getting scared when the world has literally gone to shit and is full of actual real life monsters. Ben was just trying to be a good person but, he got way over his head. I don't really hate him, but I think they should have given him a job where he can't do much wrong except dying. I had hoped he would get his redeeming moment eventually, but... Ben is just a peace of shit who always fails everything. The fact that hes such a great character is why they hate him. What us up with that? Brrrr… yeah, really scary. Ben was nice, he was scared thats all, yeah he made a lot of stupids decisions but he took them just because he thought he was helping, c'mon how would everyone of us feel if we were Ben? As far as Ben being a coward, no argument there. Amazon is asking people if they want notification by email of its DVD release. Borgnine is the real monster who makes Willard the lesser of two evils. I don't pin everything on Ben as his actions prevented a bandit attack for several weeks and he didn't cause everything and never meant any harm but I just wish he consulted the group and could of prevented so much damage. I remember, as a kid, seeing the movie on late night television, and it giving me the creeps. Follow. Anyone of us who has known or worked for a Mr. Martin is definitely rooting for Willard when it comes to these two. What enables the audience to sympathize with Willard, and the rats as well, is the quality of the monster he is up against. Bruce Davison, one of the best and most underrated character actors out there, plays Willard Stiles, a quiet and meek twenty-seven year old who lives with his aged mother in a situation that more than echoes Psycho. Synopsis   EDIT: He also saved our lives in the meat locker so he gets points for that I suppose. And when Willard gets even with Martin, Willard is far more frightening than the rats that do the deed. The only good thing that he did was sacrifice himself, and that was pretty cool of him though.. Ben's the man besides all the stupid stuff he did. Seriously people say they hate Duck but he was 10x as useful as Ben. It’s about a loner who befriends rats. Half of the deaths the group suffered were because of something he did or something he screwed up. People hate Ben because he is a stupid shitlord that is the reason for everything bad that happened after episode 2. ;-; R.I.P Ben, I will always love to hate you I pitied Ben, but boy did I hate him.  I think its pretty obvious why people hate Ben, whenever given a responsibility he fails it and in spite of that, laments when he is given sim… moreple tasks. (which I don't blame Kenny, just trying to make a point), Point is Ben was a coward and made poor decisions but he wasn't malicious, so nah, I don't hate him. Well why does everybody hate Chris? He also seems like a nice person and seems to get along with most of the group. I was hoping Ben would turn on him like he did Willard. Those kids not lucky enough (or with parents negligent enough) to see it in theaters were in front of their black and white TVs watching it and talking about it in school the next day. I just dont know why he kept being given responsibilities. Davison makes this movie. I feel sad for him, he saw his friend and teacher die, a crazy woman tried to kill him (yeah dont tell me lilly wasnt crazy before the fridge) i liked lilly but that doesnt mean she wasnt a little crazy she even said the only reason she took mark in the group was because he had food, thing is everybody hated Ben even if he killed most of the group he is not reponsible for doug or carley's dead neither for katjas dead, he didnt shoot did he? Fair enough he was a kid scared in the apocalypse but his actions got half the group wiped out and almost killed once again. He was just a kid though and I think a lot of people forget that. He was about as useful as shampoo for a bald man.  Ben begins with a clip of the end of Willard as the opening credits roll. He fucked up more times than the human with an average intelligence or even the smalle… morest of IQ wouldn't do. oh and Travis. ... Our best defense against hate speech is anti-hate speech. ple tasks. A blogger, podcaster, and reviewer of pop culture in all its forms, he's done stints in radio, journalism and video retail. He constantly bullies and berates Willard much to the delight of his fellow workers. Ask him anything about movies, television, music, or especially comics or French fries, and you’ll be hard pressed to stump him or shut him up. After this horrific start, we get an equally grisly aftermath of those events. His actions caused walkers to eat multiple bandits, chomp on Duck, eat Chuck after he shot himself, eat Brie (not too sad about that one), possibly cause Molly to run away and never to be seen again, AND bite Lee! I just can’t understand how Ben can put up with this annoying kid, but took out Willard first chance he got. http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=6J-Qbgtpsp8#t=192 Skip to about 3:15, The fact that Ben was allowed to be live was mercy enough. All rights reserved. In many ways this is an old school monster movie (it even has Kenneth Tobey! Even after I was willing to move on from the obvious mistake of keeping the deal with the bandits a secret, every one of Ben's actions in episode 4 were the writers literally going out of their way to make you hate him. Here’s the original trailer for Willard, and its sequel, Ben: With Mother dead, Willard allows the rats free reign in the big old house, as he slowly deteriorates. Willard was an event back when I was in elementary school. They could have done that and then bang! The song won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar, losing to Maureen McGovern’s “The Morning After” from The Poseidon Adventure. Willard tries to trick Ben into eating poison. Speaking of acting, it’s amazing how good Ben is, no wonder he got a sequel. Hes had it hard.     |                         In a world with only three networks and only a few UHF ones, it was easier for everyone to have watched the same show the night before, and Willard, along with things like Planet of the Apes or Helter Skelter or Roots, was one of those events.
