The audience gets to see exactly how it all went down, and Brooks’ gift is in making it all seem so reasonable, because he considers every possible eventuality. Readers expecting the nonstop scares of creepy abstract video imagery may feel let down, but Suzuki’s novel is a fascinating milestone in Japanese horror fiction.         September 1st 2002 King remains and has always been obsessed with the turbulent years of early adolescence. —Steve Foxe, It’s a curious thing to take on the concept of a “freak show” without slipping into ableism and other offensive tropes. While the broad strokes are the same, Verbinksi’s take (and director Hiroshi Takahashi’s Japanese adaptation before it) leans more supernatural than Suzuki’s. At one point, he gets his hands on a chainsaw. King sold ‘Salem’s Lot for an outstanding sum by today’s standards, let alone 1975’s, and never let up from there.  The house wants Danny, Jack’s gifted young son, and puts the Torrance family through hell to get to him. House of Leaves is told in myriad ways, including layers of footnotes, sections with color-blocked words, fake interviews with real celebrities and passages that require you to transcribe the first letter of each sentence to reveal another chapter hidden within. Judas Coyne, Hill’s Rob-Halford-meets-Glenn-Danzig protagonist, confronts both a sinister spirit and the intersection of his own myth and humanity, joined by his two loyal hounds and the latest in a string of female groupies named after their states of origin. They are truly haunting tales. —Steve Foxe, The Damnation Game proved that Books of Blood wunderkind Clive Barker could sustain his brand of fear beyond the duration of a short story. (Would have been. —Steve Foxe, Grady Hendrix is building a brand: gimmicky on the outside, surprisingly scary on the inside. They have Lovecraft, Machen, Stevenson, Stoker, Poe, Le Fanu, Blackwood, and others. —Steve Foxe, Are two immaculate little children possessed by their former caretakers? If that sounds comedic, that’s because there is a perverted sense of dark humor punctuating the novel’s scenes of shocking violence and grotesquery. The narrator’s impartial voice floats above the proceedings, never siding with one character or settling exclusively onto their perspective—at times, the third-person narration gives us glimpses into the minds of Clarice Starling, Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill. But at that point, I stopped. There’s also an intimacy present in the novel that the movie keeps at arm’s length, to the point that you genuinely worry for widower Aoyama during the infamously shocking climax. The first time I read The Monkey’s Paw, it was a rainy night. At over 800 pages (more, if you’re reading the uncut edition), The Stand includes as much horror as any of King’s other novels, spurred by a viral outbreak that kills off 99.4% of the population. The highway soon consumes his daughter’s cat and later his son. Ellis’ twisted satire of upper-class living played out much like Less Than Zero, another tale of hyper-wealthy individuals searching aimlessly for something in a world where everything was handed to them. No? —Jeff Milo, Christopher Conlon’s all-too-possible Savaging the Dark shares a premise with Alissa Nutting’s controversial Tampa, but the differences in execution are what makes this novel truly horrific and Nutting’s more of a pitch-black comedy. humorist Jason Pargin, of Cracked.com), charismatically clusters together a hip and highly evocative narrative of monstrosities, with plenty of barbs any 17-year-old could snigger at… Think of it as the horror-heavier cousin to Ready Player One. ", I checked out this collection primarily because I wanted to read The Call Of Cthulhu and The Great God Pan, which Stephen King cited as the inspiration for his novella "N." in Just After Sunset. We've got you covered with the buzziest new releases of the day. And what if a child were killed, too, then came back changed (and not for the better)? Despite a suggestion of the supernatural, it is the violence committed by very ordinary young people that will stick with you long after you’ve finished Little Star. The stories that really interested me are The Tell-Tale Heart and The Lottery. —Steve Foxe, Stephen King declared Ghost Story the finest in its genre in 1981 with the non-fiction horror critique, Danse Macabre, which, as we’ve established, is high praise indeed. What might shock one reader is laughable to another. Klein has published just one novel in his career, but it’s a hefty one, sitting at the intersection of the Arthur Machen and Clarke Ashton Smith’s Weird Fiction tradition and the ‘80s zeitgeist of psychics and impending global annihilation. Nobody had thought to take the idea of a zombie apocalypse and truly dive into the guts of everything else besides the violence, and that’s what makes Max Brooks’ book so incredible. The only unusual stipulation about the home is that the property owners’ elderly mother is to stay in the house’s top floor, confined to her apartment, and fed three times daily. —Steve Foxe, The titular phrase “a choir of ill children” is used four or five times throughout the late Tom Piccirilli’s haunting Southern Gothic, first in reference to the off-kilter musicality of protagonist Thomas’ three brothers (conjoined at the head) speaking in unison. Barker’s most compelling skill—the ability to blend lust and revulsion, desire and disgust—is on full display. —Tyler Kane & Steve Foxe, © 2020 Paste Media Group. appearances, and easily could have qualified for a few more; another has written just one novel during his decades-long career. As the novel opens, various countries have already obliterated themselves in nuclear fire, and the United States and Russia are locked in a tensely escalating standoff. I sat by the window of my bedroom, as I read I moved away from the dark window and into the light of the living room. His follow-up, My Best Friend’s Exorcism, dials back the meta-factor; aside from the yearbook-style packaging, this tale of ’80s gal pals dealing with a demonic intrusion could easily a have been a paperback original during horror’s boom period—and that’s a compliment. Hell House gets the nod on this list because it is a purer distillation of Matheson’s horror approach, and an exemplary use of the haunted house—a theme that occupies at least 10% of this list. Gaiman seamlessly crafts a reality that’s the antithesis of maternal love: cold, isolating, parasitic and directionless. Let us know what’s wrong with this preview of, Published This book was full of classing horror stories. Blatty’s text has the time and space to better establish all of its key players, specifically Father Damien Karras, layering on the dread long before the pea soup starts flying. With its impeccably researched setting and its unflinching look at evils both known and unknown, Broken Monsters is the best work yet from a young horror writer to watch. When she arrives at his impressive estate, she finds herself at the mercy of a housekeeper who remains fiercely loyal to the widower’s late wife, and has no hesitance in making that clear to the protagonist—or in undermining the protagonist’s confidence and sense of security however possible. Rosemary’s going to have a baby, you see, and everyone is very excited for the new arrival. That’s a damn good combination to make for a compelling reading experience. And when those forces wake up to the annoyance of human incursion? Ever wonder why the English language has the word Lovecraftian, but not the word Poean? She only comes out at night, but more than anything, she’s a pillar of support to lonely Oskar. Written in the wake of her young daughter’s death, Rice’s first installment in The Vampire Chronicles is a psychosexual marvel, and a turning point in vampire fiction. In Pet Sematary King swings it wide. I picked up this book on a whim. Unlike The Shining, the film never diverges too widely from the source material, but that shouldn’t keep horror fans from picking up the novel. This story within a story within a story relays a nameless host’s discovery of a manuscript about a poor woman hired to watch two bizarre adolescents. T. I checked out this collection primarily because I wanted to read The Call Of Cthulhu and The Great God Pan, which Stephen King cited as the inspiration for his novella "N." in Just After Sunset. —Sean Edgar, Possession tales are terrifying for a specific reason. It’s a grand, ornate adventure that wears its horror on its sleeve. Whether rural ghosts corrupted the innocent or not, we’re ultimately left with (117-year-old spoiler alert) a confused woman holding a small child’s lifeless body. King infamously hates Kubrick’s adaptation, and while it’s hard to debate the film’s quality or place in the horror movie pantheon, the novel is the more nuanced and, arguably, scarier version of the story, topiary monsters and all. There were the classic tales like "The Tell Tale Heart" and "The Monkey's Paw". —Tyler Kane, H.P. I'd highly recommend it if you like Lovecraft. I only read 'The Great God Pan' by Arthur Machen, but it was really good. My favorite story in the collection was probably "The Willows" by Algernon Blackwood. With some of our most famous horror stories—ones that follow knife-wielding masked madmen, houses that consume humans, scorned telekinetic teens—the victim, even in death, retains control of his or her own mind. —Steve Foxe, While horror has always flourished on the small-press scene, Lauren Beaukes is helping to forge a continued legacy for the genre at major publishers as well. Even better? "Some may ask where I get the authority to compile such a work, and attach such lofty claims to it. Rice’s vampires are tortured souls who’ve lived too long, trapped in bodies that refuse to age. Ghosts, serial killers, great heaving monsters, the loss of self-control, plagues, impossible physics and a creepy clown all figure into our countdown, with entries spanning from the 1800s to the last few years. I'd read most of them--the only new one was "The Beckoning Fair One" by Oliver Onions--but it was nice to sit down and curl up with them. I read this book in honor of Halloween. While most of the horrors awaiting the ship’s crew are all-too-real—shrinking rations, scurvy, bitter cold—there’s a looming supernatural presence driving the survivors farther from civilization and any hope of rescue. A traveling carnival brings tempting delights and sinister frights, and readers young and old should find this one to be a timeless autumnal classic. Top Ten Horror Stories of all Time Growing up in the 1980s in a remote sixteenth-century farmhouse in deepest, darkest Somerset, England, did wonders for my imagination and interest in the macabre. I honestly don't have much to say about this book. For some, it may seem like senseless violence for nothing—but the whole tale is a deep delve into Ellis’ own alienation and madness in the late ‘80s. Well, when that happens, “madness” might be our species only respite. The mounting terror of the Navidson family is all embedded within the story of a young tattoo artist losing his grip on reality. is largely unknown to modern fans. —Sean Edgar, Carrie was an explosive start, but Stephen King’s second published novel best forecasted what to expect from the horror genre’s most outstanding author. Don’t wimp out of reading this in favor of the AMC television series—Simmons is a long-time genre master finding new ways to reinvent himself each decade. Not a big fiction reader I thought it was time to delve into the realm of terror for a little aversion from my typical non-fiction fare. All Rights Reserved. Night Things isn’t merely about a ghost haunting the halls of an old mansion, though—the lake house at the center of the novel is a labyrinthine creation taunting protagonist Lauren Montgomery’s family with hidden rooms, doors that open to nowhere and a macabre secret hidden at its center. Amusingly, the novel also features the first of King’s many writer protagonists.
