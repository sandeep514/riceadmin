The attempt to assassinate Hitler was part of a larger plan on the part of Wehrmacht officers Colonel Henning von Tresckow, Lieutenant Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, and General Friedrich Olbricht, among others, to seize power in Germany, depose the Nazi regime, and make peace with the Allies. The blast devastated the meeting room, killing one person, and leaving three others with fatal wounds. Despite the confusion, the Reserve Army began arresting high-ranking Nazi leadership in Berlin. They knew they would only have one chance, and if there was any chance of failure at all they couldn’t risk going through with it. Stauffenberg decided to carry out the assassination attempt himself during a meeting with Hitler and other military officers at the Wolf’s Lair – the Nazi leader’s sprawling military base.

Hundreds of thousands of perceived opponents found themselves imprisoned in concentration camps, while others were killed outright. Everything was going as planned until the plot suffered its first setback: The weather on July 20th was unusually hot, which prompted Hilterâs officials to change the venue of the meeting from the reinforced, underground bunker to the conference hut of Wolfâs Lair.

However, none of these previous attempts had ever gotten to the point of actually throwing a grenade or pulling the trigger of a gun; something had always come up at the last minute to force them to call the plot off. Although the plot failed to generate the expected results, it became a burning symbol of German Resistance and showed the world that not all Germans were like Hitler and the Nazi Party. How badly injured a person is during an explosion depends on their proximity to the bomb; the nearer the person is, the higher the chances of the person sustaining fatal injuries. “They were often the traditional elite, the best educated, with foreign connections, and with a sense of obligation to the idea of Germany,” says Roger Moorhouse, an historian who has written several books on Nazi Germany, including Killing Hitler: The Third Reich and the Plots Against the Führer. As Gerlach points out, however, certain members opposed a transition to democracy, preferring instead a “kind of corporative state, perhaps a semi-authoritarian state.” He adds that several plotters “wanted to keep some annexed territories.”. There were many, like those involved in the plot, who were willing to sacrifice their own lives to liberate Germany from his tyrannical rule. Stauffenberg planted the explosive in a briefcase, which he placed under a table, then left quickly. Subscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox. He gave Il Duce a tour of the bomb site.) However, as the failure of Operation Valkyrie shows, even the most carefully thought-out plans can become completely unraveled by the simple element of luck. Even though Stauffenberg knew this was the case, he pushed forward, believing that two bombs would still be adequate to level the room and kill anyone inside of it. Stauffenberg â and the fate of the entire plot â now relied on the potency of the one live explosive that he carried into the conference hall. Minutes later Stauffenberg left the Wolf’s Lair, believing Hitler was dead and returned to Berlin.

Hitler became convinced that fate had spared him—”I regard this as a confirmation of the task imposed upon me by Providence”—and that “nothing is going to happen to me… [T]he great cause which I serve will be brought through its present perils and…everything can be brought to a good end.”, READ MORE: 6 Assassination Attempts on Adolf Hitler, https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/assassination-plot-against-hitler-fails. Fed up with Hitler, though only partially for moral reasons, high-level German resisters nearly succeeded in assassinating him in July 1944. Unfortunately, the most well-known assassination plot on Hitler’s life, popularly known as the July Plot or Operation Valkyrie, proved unsuccessful for reasons that could have been avoided, and others that are unexplained to this day. A German officer holds the tattered remains of a uniform worn by one of Adolf Hitler's top officers during the failed assassination attempt. Stauffenberg planted a briefcase packed with explosives under a table that Hitler was using. More than 7,000 Germans would be arrested (including evangelical pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer), and up to 5,000 would wind up dead—either executed or as suicides. Even Tresckow oversaw the wholesale destruction of villages on the Eastern Front. The worst execution was reserved for the brother of one of the conspirators. His problem were his injuries which made it difficult to prime the bombs for the attempt. Seventy five years ago a bomb plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler came tantalisingly close to killing the Nazi dictator and changing the course of World War II.

Stauffenberg, who had lost his left eye, his right hand and some fingers on his left hand during the war, immediately flew back to Berlin to launch the planned uprising to overthrow the regime. The plan was for von Stauffenberg to arm the bombs, which were on timer fuses and hidden in briefcases, and then carry the two briefcases into the meeting. On 7 July, a planned suicide bombing by General Stieff during the presentation of new army uniforms at Schloss Klessheim near Salzburg failed, because Stieff lost his nerve. According to historian Ian Kershaw, conflicting reports arrived about the fate of Hitler during the explosion. He armed one bomb, entered the cabin and took his place at the table, with only one person sitting between himself and Hitler. When von Stauffenberg left the room, another officer, Colonel Heinz Brandt, took his place – and, finding von Stauffenberg’s briefcase near his feet, shifted it a few inches away. These dissidents, though never “a statistically relevant” percentage of the German population, actively “tried to bring down Hitler’s government,” Hoffmann says.
