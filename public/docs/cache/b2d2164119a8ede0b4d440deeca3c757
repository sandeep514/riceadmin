[16] PÃ©tin said that Schneider's cardiac arrest was due to a weakened heart caused by a kidney operation she had months before. [15], Schneider was found dead in her Paris apartment on 29 May 1982. "'Jaws' was the first big, blockbuster outdoor-adventure film. "I've been fortunate to do what I consider three landmark films," he told The Associated Press in 1986. He was married twice and is survived by three children. In 2004, Scheider was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, which is cancer that forms in a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell. He spent long periods in bed, becoming a voracious reader. He was what I call a knockaround actor. Although Jaws is credited with frightening some filmgoers out of the water for years, Scheider considered his role rather comedic. "And certainly All That Jazz is not like any old MGM musical. â âJawsâ was the first big, blockbuster outdoor-adventure film. Schneider decided to live and to work in France, slowly gaining the interest of film directors such as Orson Welles for The Trial (1962), based upon Franz Kafka's The Trial. Schneider continued to work in France during the 1970s, most notably with director Claude Sautet on five films. "If you go back and look at the way it's developed and built, that is really a funny character," he said. In 2005, one of Scheider's most famous lines from Jaws - "You're gonna need a bigger boat" - was voted number 35 on the American Film Institute's list of best quotes. He reprised his role as Amity police chief Brody in the less successful Jaws 2 in 1978. [23] In November 2009, the ARD broadcast the feature film RomyÂ [de] with Jessica Schwarz in the title role.

Following the end of her relationship with Delon, Schneider married German director and actor Harry Meyen in July 1966. Except for a slight heart murmur, he was pronounced cured at 17. Scheider was also politically active. The examining magistrate Laurent DavenasÂ [fr] declared that she died from cardiac arrest. In her first year Romy was given into the hands of a governess. It was during the filming of Christine that Schneider fell in love with French actor Alain Delon, who co-starred in the movie. â Shortly afterwards, Delon arranged for David to be buried in the same grave. Schneider began drinking alcohol excessively after his death. He spent three years in the air force before becoming a theatre actor in New York in the early Sixtiesand then moving into films, making a breakthrough in 1971 as Jane Fonda's pimp in Klute. Its success catapulted the career of director Steven Spielberg (it was only his second theatrical film), and heralded a new era in Hollywood blockbusters. Copyright Â© 2020 CBS Interactive Inc.

In July 1981, Schneider's son David died at the age of 14 after attempting to climb the spiked fence at his stepfather's parents' home and puncturing his femoral artery in the process. Roy Richard Scheider is part of the Silent Generation, which followed after the G.I.
