</html>";s:4:"text";s:9332:"On the field, I like Pena. Reed is on the list solely because of his raw power. The former 26th round pick is a tall, lanky right hander that has yet to impress in two pro seasons. He has a low 90’s fastball from the left side with a major league ready change and a good breaking pitch. In fact, of the 93 games he has appeared in over his three year pro career, he has finished 40 of them. Copyright 1999- 2017 Highest Level: Single-A The front office has come out and said they are going to look to improve the big league club through free agency as opposed to trading away prospects like in years past. Mendez has been a highly touted prospect in the Rangers system for some time now and after a brutal major league debut in 2016, the lefty got another shot in 2017. He wasn’t on the list because I simply couldn’t find the right place to put him. Opening Day Age: 19 50. Yes, he did spend the majority of the 2017 campaign in High-A, but his career looks a lot different now thanks to his time in Single-A. He has some extreme value for our fantasy purposes as well. The rookie righthander has impressed early in the season as a setup man out of the big league bullpen. The Winter Garden, FL product has great raw power and plus speed to go with it. Carlos Tocci, OF Whatley is a defense first catcher, but he may be worth stashing in dynasty leagues. Jurado spent the entire 2017 season at Double-A and things did not go as planned. Thanks, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, 3B Whatley impressed in his first professional season after being drafted in the third round out of Oral Roberts. The Rangers have shown confidence in him despite some lackluster numbers in the minors. Gardewine made his big league debut in 2017 and it was a rough eight innings where he posted a 2.13 WHIP. His defense will help him move up the minor league ladder. Adam Choplick, LHP Opening Day Age: 20 The Rangers began the season on March 29 against the Houston Astros and finished the season on September 30 against the Seattle Mariners. Now, the Rangers have signed him to a two year deal in hopes that he can be a bullpen asset over the next couple of seasons. He has a riding fastball that is hard to square up and a plus breaking ball. 2017 Highest Level: Triple-A The Rangers began the season on March 29 against the Houston Astros  and finished the season on September 30 against the Seattle Mariners. I’ll be the first to admit, Matuella may be a high risk, high reward pitcher, but I’m leaning towards reward. All signs point to him staying at shortstop over his pro career due to his plus defensive tools. They have a nice combination of young players on the big league roster and some promising prospects waiting in the pipeline. Many folks have dropped him in prospect rankings, but I have a lot of faith in him. 26. A first round pick in 2017, Seise played at two levels last year. The former Oral Roberts standout slashed just .241/.275/.323 in 2017 with nine homers, the fewest in his four year pro career. Martin has had some trouble staying healthy over his career. He may start the season back in Single-A, but don’t be surprised to see him spend some time in High-A in 2018. He is more of a defensive catcher, but there is potential for a little pop in the bat. A couple of Tommy John surgeries is the only reason Choplick isn’t in Tier 3. 2017 Highest Level: Rookie Scott Heineman, OF Crouse has an explosive, almost violent delivery. Still, he has a long way to go before being considered for a spot on your dynasty roster. Still, I don’t see enough offensive value to roster him. The 6’4 righty performed well as a reliever last year and he shows signs of being a solid bullpen arm in the future, maybe even a closer. 			document.write(update); Opening Day Age: 25 He has a decent breaking ball, but hitters at the higher levels can catch up to the blistering fastball and he has been struggling to adjust to that. He wasn’t on the list because I simply couldn’t find the right place to put him. Where what happened yesterday is being preserved today. Blackburn was once a highly rated prospect in the. 2017 Highest Level: Short Season Alexy was one of the prospects the Rangers got back in the Darvish trade and he didn’t miss a beat after joining their system in 2017. He is very confident when he climbs the hill and he is not afraid to show it. There is enough potential in the bat to store him in your dynasty leagues. 			update=copyright.getFullYear(); He tossed 22 innings in his pro debut with a WHIP of just 0.91 while striking out 19 and walking two. He has good movement on his low 90’s fastball and already has a plus change and breaking ball to go with it. Opening Day Age: 22 9. Visit ESPN to view the Texas Rangers team roster for the current season The lefty has a good strikeout to walk ratio, but the WHIP was a little high in 2017. Hernandez split time between Single-A and High-A in 2017 and pitched better after he was promoted. Depending on how he comes back from the surgery, Fasola may get a shot at some time in a major league bullpen in the near future, but that is his ceiling. He didn’t log a hit after the trade, but posted an .840 OPS on the season. While the jury is out on just how valuable of an outfielder he will be in fantasy, Heineman has enough tools that he deserves a roster spot in dynasty leagues. AL West, General, MiLB, Rangers, Top 50 Lists The outfielder typically posts around a .750 OPS and he seems to be more of a “Quad-A” type of guy. He recently signed with the Rangers after the ATL scandal. There is some potential for Beras to make an impact as a pitcher due to his near triple digit fastball and his slider, but the mechanics need to improve immensely before that happens. 2017 Highest Level: High-A Tocci hasn’t been a force at the plate over his career, but he did post a career high .727 OPS last season against his toughest competition yet. The “2017 Highest Level” is a little misleading in the case of Beras. The former 26th round pick is a tall, lanky right hander that has yet to impress in two pro seasons. Ricardo Rodriguez, RHP Well, things didn’t quite go as planned over the first four and a half years of his pro career, so the 6’6 righty is now trying to cut it as a pitcher. Kyle Cody, RHP  Do you think you may have underestimated Kiner-Falefa’s ceiling? A top University of Washington arm, Bremer was selected by the Rangers in the sixth round of the 2017 draft. Taveras has the potential to … Springs is worth keeping an eye because of his high strikeout rate, but it remains to be seen if that is legitimate or just a byproduct of him being much older than his opponents. Rangers fans may be familiar with Beras due to his promising power potential after being signed out of the Dominican Republic. 2017 Highest Level: High-A Well, things didn’t quite go as planned over the first four and a half years of his pro career, so the 6’6 righty is now trying to cut it as a pitcher. He started his first season of affiliated ball in Single-A where he slashed .324/.413/.546 over 46 games before getting a promotion to Double-A. The club was coming off of back to back AL West titles and although they weren’t the favorites to win the division entering the season, many considered them to be the frontrunners for a wild card spot. I felt it was important to mention Blackburn because of how close he is to the majors. Boston Red Sox 2018 Top 50 Prospects (and baseball cards!). Many folks have dropped him in prospect rankings, but I have a lot of faith in him. 32. Aparicio will turn 19 just days before the 2018 season starts and he will have a lot of eyes on him. Blackburn is a guy that can add some value to your roster very, very soon. C.D. However, he is worth rostering if you see your dynasty team needing relief pitching in the future. Opening Day Age: 19 If there weren’t injury concerns, Matuella would be higher on this list. Jurado spent the entire 2017 season at Double-A and things did not go as planned. Arredondo is still being developed as a starter and has struck out nearly a batter per inning over his pro career. Anderson Tejeda, SS/2B He strikes out more than we would like to see, but that is to be expected from a 19-year-old in Single-A. His good mechanics and consistent approach have led many to put Cole Hamels comps on the young southpaw. 2017 Highest Level: High-A He is a little bit undersized, but has a nice fastball from the left hand side with a breaking ball that he can throw for strikes. Palumbo was added to the 40-man roster to protect him from last year’s Rule 5 draft. He wasn’t a starter in his debut season, but struck out 30 and walked just four over 20 innings in Short Season. Opening Day Age: 21 The 22-year-old righty has logged over 600 minor league innings and has never spent a full season in one uniform. 24. 2017 Highest Level: High-A 2017 Highest Level: Single-A He was drafted by the Rockies, but was quickly sidelined with a shoulder injury that nearly ended his pitching career. Opening Day Age: 25 All Rights Reserved by Baseball Almanac, Inc.Hosted by Hosting 4 Less. So, instead of giving him an unfair ranking, I wanted to mention him separately. Jenkins was a highly touted outfielder entering the 2015 draft, but has yet to live up to the hype.
