The MFA statement may be “silly”, and Thein Sein might be higher in the hierarchy, but there is a crucial difference between both: the MFA statement is a more faithful reflection of the Burmese government actions than Thein Sein’s words. Based on the Random House Unabridged Dictionary, © Random House, Inc. 2020, Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 2012 Digital Edition  Need to translate "trespasser" to Gujarati? It is a task complicated by the fact that the ethnic, and national categories employed in these censuses are far from consistent. The full statement in English as issued by the MFA appeared in the Working People’s Daily of 22 February 1992 and may be found on the Network Myanmar website. Mr Tonkin can find all this information in the paper by Nyi Nyi Kyaw “Unpacking the Presumed Statelessness of But what happens to the large and still-marginalised migrant communities in Thai border towns like Mae Sot? Look it up now! পাপী; অন্যায়ভাবে সীমালঙ্ঘনকারী; অনাধিকার-প্রবেশকারী; ( অশোধ্য বা অনাদায়ী ঋন ; যে ঋন শোধ করা যাবে না  ), Download ইংরেজি গ্রামার (English-Bangla) App, Words and Terms for Every Internet Users (Part 1). But such injustice is based on a lie, the gross exaggeration of the numbers of “illegals”. You only need to read diplomatic and press reports of meetings between Pakistani/Bangladeshi and Burmese officials and politicians during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s to know that the problem of illegal migration from Bengal into Arakan was a continuing issue which both sides sought to contain and resolve, and even to downplay in public statements. Now, I have never claimed any censuses conducted in Burma, or many other countries for that matter, perfectly account for each and everyone of the people living in the territory covered in them, but, as I said in the text, they can provide decent orders of magnitude. At the same time, many Rakhine have migrated to Malaysia or Thailand in search of economic opportunities denied at home.

To play the devil’s advocate, in ascertaining how many Muslims in Arakan may be “illegal” we can make a projection of growth for the Muslim population according to the growth of the non-Muslim population in the state except the Hindu population (as it shrank considerably due to specific factors) That rate was 104.5%. The 1983 census is not an exception. Notify me of follow-up comments by email. Nations, who are hostile, will be deterred from their attempts. I stand with what I said: successive Burmese governments have greatly exaggerated the “problem of illegal immigration” as a smokescreen for a project of nation-building in which it has decided that the Rohingya have no place. His credibility is seriously put in doubt by no other than the British ambassador himself, who at the end of the report asserts: “I do not regard [the Bangladeshi ambassador] Mr Kaiser as an entirely reliable source of evidence. And, whatever illegal immigration there may have been until that point, it was reduced significantly as a result of a more tight control of the border imposed from then on. The irony is that the very same policies carried out over four decades by the Burmese state in its attempts to contain the Rohingya population have contributed to its demographic explosion. A statement by a Head of State as recently as 2012 surely takes precedence over a fatuous press release issued 20 years previously by a government department. Nobody, however, has provided any evidence of massive waves of “illegal Bengalis”. The 1983 Census puts  the “Bangladeshi” community in Arakan at 497,208 which may be taken as a base figure for non-Kaman Arakan Muslims, and is totally compatible with Mr Kaiser’s 1975 figure of “upward of ½ million”. However, an earlier estimate I had made of 30% I reduced some months ago to “not significantly exceeding 15%”, and this under the influence of the writer’s persuasive arguments elsewhere. As regards the 1953-54 Census, Professor Hugh Tinker notes on Page 357 of his 1957 book “The Union of Burma”, where he examines the pressures in the late 1940s for the cession of Maungdaw and Buthidaung to Pakistan: “In Buthidaung town about 60 per cent of the population are classified according to the current census as Pakistanis; in Maungdaw town about 45 per cent are Pakistanis (see Census, Release No. As the results of the classification by ethnicity in 2014 census have not been released, it is impossible to know the exact number of Rakhine internal migrants living elsewhere in Burma. Why? “Epidemic” vs. “Pandemic” vs. “Endemic”: What Do These Terms Mean? At that time, I used exactly the same methodology I have used here, comparing the growth of different populations between two censuses. Mr Tonkin seems to be unable to see his own inconsistencies, and he contributes to create more confusion in an already terribly complex matter. Successive British Ambassadors reported on this, including Ambassador Whitteridge who in a despatch dated 28 January 1964 noted: “The Moslems in that portion of Arakan which adjoins the border with East Pakistan number about 400,000 and have lived there for generations and have acquired Burmese nationality. trespass definition: 1. to go onto someone's land or enter their building without permission: 2. to do something or act…. And no law enacted after independence by the Burmese government, not even the infamous 1982 Citizenship Law, has made immigration during the colonial period retroactively illegal. The MFA statement of 21 February 1992 is silly because it states: “Since the First Anglo-Myanmar War in 1824, people of Muslim faith from the adjacent country illegally entered Myanmar Naing-Ngan, particularly Rakhine State.”. The overwhelming majority of the Rohingya at the time of the MFA Ministry’s statement were treated as if they were “illegals” and stripped of their citizenship, while the Thein Sein administration didn’t put his words into action, except for the pilot citizenship verification program conducted in Myebon in 2014, a drop in the ocean clearly conducted in bad faith, in which only a very tiny percentage were granted citizenship.

But they show clearly the confusion prevalent at the time, and now, about the Muslim population in Arakan, artificially classified as Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Bengali and of foreign origins. deter 1579, from L. deterrere, from de- "away" + terrere "frighten." Mr Tonkin dismisses the MFA statement in 1992 about “illegal immigrants” too easily and gives too much importance to statement made by Thein Sein in 2012 on the same issue. Also, we shouldn’t forget that, for all the talk about migration to Arakan in the first three decades after Burma’s independence, there was also migration from Arakan to East Pakistan/Bangladesh. For Mr Tonkin that seems to be a mere anecdote without much relevance, but the classification reveals the crux of the issue: Muslims in Arakan were overwhelmingly regarded as foreigners. The paper asserts that “in 1971, there were around half a million war refugees who fled into Myanmar […] to escape the violence of the Bangladeshi war of independence.”. 10 Types Of Nouns Used In The English Language. Mr Galache makes a lot – far too much – out of the silly comment by the Myanmar MFA in 1992 that Muslims have been entering the country “illegally” since 1824. Mr Galache asked about my sources. There is no reason to believe he meant that half a million Bengalis migrated to Arakan after Burmese independence, let alone after the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971. That was mostly due to the Indian exodus during World War II, when up to half a million Indians fled Burma, and during the nationalisations of Ne Win during the mid-1960s, when around 300,000 left. According to colonial laws, migration from any part of India to Burma was perfectly legal. "deterred meaning in bengali". Subsequently almost 17,000 Bengalis returned though the number that remained in Arakan continues to be unknown.” And in the conversation between the two diplomats, the British ambassador recounts that his Bangladeshi counterpart “admitted that there were upward of ½ million Bangalee [sic] trespassers in Arakan whom the Burmese had some right to eject”.

See my report here: http://sea-globe.com/forever-lost-meet-the-rohingya-who-sacrificed-their-identity-for-myanmar-citizenship/ In both cases, the stripping of citizenship from the Rohingya in the late eighties and early nineties and the pilot program in 2014, the Rohingya are regarded by default as foreigners, regardless of when their ancestors may have arrived to Arakan and the laws themselves that the Burmese state claims to follow. When Operation Naga Min was conducted, the number of “illegal immigrants” apprehended was extremely low, a little bit more than 1,000 in Sittwe, less than 600 in Buthidaung and 230 in Maungdaw.
