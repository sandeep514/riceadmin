This film, based on the true-life case of a multiple personality, chronicles Dr. Luther's attempts to reconcile the three faces of Eve. While she is aware of everything Eve White says and does, Eve Black's activities are unknown to the quiet and soft-spoken Eve White. In her autobiography I'm Eve, Chris Costner-Sizemore remarked on the fact that the movie did not portray her real life at all. When Alistair Cooke shows up to introduce Three Faces of Eve, we know that the fact-based story will bear more than a little fidelity to truth. [2], Thigpen and Cleckley diagnosed Sizemore and treated her at no cost for several years. In one episode depicted in the film, she wrapped the cord of a venetian blind around the neck of her young daughter, Taffy, when the child would not stop crying. Eve Black confronts Ralph at his motel where he not only realizes Eve Black is real, but also she convinces him to take her to Jacksonville. In later years she was a frequent speaker on behalf of people with mental illness and an accomplished figurative painter. Telling Costner-Sizemore she was too mentally ill to take charge of her own affairs, Thigpen made all the arrangements with Twentieth-Century Fox Studios to film his version of her life story. At the end of the 1957 film ''The Three Faces of Eve,'' which depicted the struggle of a young woman with multiple personality disorder, Eve, the title character, drives off … According to her 1977 memoir, “I’m Eve,” written with a relative, Elen Sain Pittillo, she was scarred further by an early romance with a sadistic man, who beat her. The Three Faces of Eve is a 1957 film which is loosely based on the true story of a woman who suffered from Dissociative identity disorder.It stars Joanne Woodward, David Wayne and Lee J. Cobb. [12] John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote that Woodward "does well in a role that is inevitably full of confusion", but the film "seems rather fantastic when it depicts the heroine going through her mental gyrations at top speed". By Costner-Sizemore's later account (related in her books I'm Eve and A Mind Of My Own as well as numerous interviews), he was acting as her sole representative with Fox, and simultaneously as Fox's representative with her, while continuing to see her in counseling. Critics uniformly praised Joanne Woodward's performance, but opinions of other aspects of the film were more mixed. In 1970 she started treatment with Tony Tsitos, whom she credited with making the greatest progress in integrating the divergent personalities over the next four years. She began seeing Dr. Thigpen in Augusta, Ga., after her first marriage, when she began alternating between the demure and depressed Eve White and the self-indulgent party girl Eve Black, perplexing her husband with her bizarrely shifting behavior.

The Three Faces of Eve is a 1957 American mystery drama film presented in CinemaScope, based on the book of the same name about the life of Chris Costner Sizemore, which was written by psychiatrists Corbett H. Thigpen and Hervey M. Cleckley, who also helped write the screenplay. Eve White is sent to a hospital for observation after Eve Black is found strangling Eve White's daughter, Bonnie. In "The Three Faces of Eve," Thigpen and his colleague, Hervey Cleckley, presented the world with a happily-ever-after ending. The book recounts in detail the case of Eve White, a young housewife locked in an unhappy marriage to a well-meaning, but overwhelmed, husband. The original Three Faces of Eve book was rushed into publication and film rights immediately sold to director Nunnally Johnson in 1957, apparently to capitalize on public interest in multiple personalities following the publication of Shirley Jackson's 1954 novel The Birds' Nest, which was made into the 1957 film Lizzie. multiple personalities. Until, Eve White (a pseudonym) was referred to Thigpen and Cleckley in Augusta by her local physician in 1951. “I once weighed 175 pounds because I was feeding three different people in the same body different meals,” she said. In Mrs. Sizemore’s case, the fragmentation in her mind began when she was as young as 2, after she had witnessed a series of gruesome incidents, including her mother being bloodily injured in a kitchen accident, the funeral of an infant, the dragging of a corpse from a ditch and a man being “cut in half by a saw at a lumber mill,” she told The Post. But she was unable, at the time, to do anything about it, because she was not allowed to disclose her real identity as "Eve." Later, Thigpen tried to stop her from writing I'm Eve in 1977, claiming that he had the sole rights to the story of her life. To understand its impact, one must consider the cultural climate of the United States following, This atmosphere fostered a keen interest in psychology and psychiatry, and general readers devoured works popularizing these previously esoteric fields. Costner, Chris; with Pittillo, Elen (1977). Be the first to contribute! However, Spacek was subsequently contacted by Fox representatives, who claimed that the proposed film could not be made because Fox owned all rights to Costner-Sizemore's life story in perpetuity.

Her system did not integrate until much later, and she found her therapist's portrayal of her exploitive. It was a reversal of roles for Woodward, who played the psychiatrist who diagnosed Sybil Dorsett (played by Sally Field, who subsequently won an Primetime Emmy Award for her portrayal) with multiple personality disorder and subsequently led her through treatment. The book received praise for its meticulous documentation and its general readability. This story, however, was a groundbreaker when it appeared. By Costner-Sizemore's account, Dr. Thigpen used her story for personal gain. 20th Century Fox Even so, the way her divided self presented itself was remarkable; some … The sunny narrative of Mrs. Sizemore’s triumphant second act was called into some question in 2012, when Colin A. Ross, a psychiatrist specializing in dissociation, published a book, “The Rape of Eve,” in which he accused Dr. Thigpen of having exercised an unethical, Svengali-like influence over Mrs. Sizemore and manipulating her for nefarious purposes during and after his treatment of her ended.

The sudden changes in personality seriously affects Eve's marriage and she undergoes a lengthy period of hospitalization.

Christine "Chris" Costner Sizemore (April 4, 1927 – July 24, 2016)  was an American woman who, in the 1950s, was diagnosed with multiple personality disorder, now known as dissociative identity disorder. She also wrote a follow-up book, A Mind Of My Own (1989). She was "Eve," the subject of the best seller The Three Faces of Eve and the 1957 movie of the same title.

His previous public service included a stint in the U.S. The Three Faces of Eve both a best-selling book and a major motion picture, is the true story of a young housewife who suffered from multiple personality disorder (MPD). At the start of the 1957 movie “The Three Faces of Eve,” the British-born journalist Alistair Cooke, who narrates the film, appears on camera to tell viewers that the incredible tale they are about to see is a true story — not suggested by or based on something that happened, but a facsimile of actual events. She was living as Jane, happily married and reunited with a young daughter from a previous marriage that had been irreparably rent by her illness. The film won the Academy Award for Best Actress (Joanne Woodward), at that time a relative unknown, who later went on to play Dr. Cornelia Wilbur in Sybil (film). Costner-Sizemore took Fox to Federal District Court in Manhattan in 1988 with the help of attorney Carol Rinsler, who argued that Costner-Sizemore was incompetent at the time, and that Fox's behavior in 1977 -- paying her for the rights to "I'm Eve" -- was inconsistent with their belief that they already owned the rights to her life story. Apparently, Eve's terror led to create different personalities. Eve Black knew all about Eve White and scorned White's life and marriage as a boring waste of time.

During one therapy session, party-girl Eve Black emerged. Her new marriage turned out to be not an ending at all; she endured a fragmented identity until the mid-1970s, seeing several psychiatrists after Thigpen and Cleckley, until, in the care of a Virginia doctor, Tony Tsitos, her personalities — not three but more than 20, it turned out — were unified.
