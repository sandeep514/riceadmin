Whats most appealing about it compared to other books that deal with the same topic is that it is very simple to understand. During his twenty-five year career with the Investigative Support Unit, Special Agent John Douglas became a legendary figure in law enforcement, pursuing some of the most notorious and sadistic serial killers of our time: the man who hunted prostitutes for sport in the woods of Alaska, the Atlanta child murderer, and Seattle's Green River killer, the case that nearly cost Douglas his life. And Mr. Fincher’s “House of Cards,” also for Netflix, has not exactly been a model of subtlety. We're here for the cases, John, not your life story!

Pocket Books; 7.2.1996 Edition (August 1, 1996), Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2017. It’s the perfect background for a series that also knows it needs to deliver the goods episodically as well. Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2018. “Mindhunter” was created by the playwright Joe Penhall, who wrote the first season with Jennifer Haley; the executive producers include Mr. Fincher and Charlize Theron. I was hooked! He captured my interest and held it throughout the entire book. Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 21, 2017, What should have been a really interesting read is marred by the fact that Douglas is so self congratulating its detracts from the cases. That is, at least, the lofty goal that Holden aspires to when we first meet him, as someone whose life is work and who, for much of this first season, believes his work doesn’t affect his life.

There has been so much snobbery in this Second Golden Age of Television when it comes to procedural setups versus novelistic storytelling, and yet, there shouldn’t be (especially since so many series butcher attempts at the latter). I just ordered Obsession, looking forward to it!! One of the most fascinating things about Mindhunter (created by Jonathan Penhall but essentially taken over by David Fincher) is how it is a procedural, yet also eschews the typical beats of a procedural. He wanted to know who these men were to stop other men like them. This book is incredibly well written and a total page turner. Using his uncanny ability to become both predator and prey, Douglas examines each crime scene, reliving both the killer's and the victim's actions in his mind, creating their profiles, describing their habits, and predicting their next moves.  I also saw people saying it was boring. In the title sequence, images of death flicker briefly on screen over the meticulous loading of a reel-to-reel tape machine. Something went wrong. Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2018. There was a problem loading your book clubs. Very close to the Netflix series, I watched right after reading. The author John Douglas, starts off the book going into his background and how he got involved with the Bureau and after that, the book just literally goes case by case, crime by crime, killer by killer, from chapter to chapter with some elements of the author's personal life progressing through. He finds help in agent Bill Tench (Holt McCallany), a behavioral-science specialist. I find forensic psychology absolutely fascinating and this book just fuelled my interest! Let’s hope not; the chase after ideas here is more interesting. It wasn’t released for review except to a handful of critics, and even then just the first two episodes. Yet Holden was never interested in the victims — he humanized and fully realized the assailants. But that push and pull was necessary — Holden had to push Bill into the future, and Bill had to hold him back from taking things too far. I wanted to learn more about forensic investigation and criminal profiling, it seemed with the writers experience who would have a wealth of knowledge, but I wasted hours of my time on this book with virtually none of the information I wanted to know. They also play into the bigger behavioral project, as the Road School is left behind; but the Road School was also an important part of Bill and Holden getting access to these heinous, small-town crimes, and often those who committed them. Something we hope you'll especially enjoy: FBA items qualify for FREE Shipping and Amazon Prime. But the notion that killers like him can be figured out and foiled is like placing a bet on reason over chaos. A mixture of his life story and profiling cases for the FBI. Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 27, 2019. Mr. Fincher, who directed four episodes, gives “Mindhunter” that restrained sensibility: micro-eruptions of primal blood through a facade of clean meticulous order. I'm on page 84 and I'm waiting for it to get beyond the constant 'I'm so cool and hilarious' stories. See the full list at Watching, The New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation site.

An ace procedural is one of TV’s greatest delights, and the most effective series are ones that successfully incorporate those Story of the Week narratives while weaving them into larger arcs. When I saw that Netflix planned a drama about serial-murder investigations executive-produced by David Fincher — the director of “Seven” and “Zodiac” — my gut reaction was: Stop, you’re killing me. I loved the Netflix series and look forward to season 2. As the DA from Georgia says, until you can fully realize the pain and horror that the victims went through, you cannot fully process what these men are capable of. One Of The Best Books On Criminal Justice Around, Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2019. Please try again. Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2019. But “Mindhunter,” whose first season appears Friday, is more academic than sensationalistic, at least in the two episodes made available to critics. Full of cases. There has been plenty written about the glorification of serial killers on television, especially of late, but this was compounded by the more immediate fact that Netflix did almost no marketing for the series. The relationship between the two was particularly fascinating throughout this season because of how difficult it is to categorize. In the end, with Bill alienated and Holden left to his own devices, he did take things too far. ‘Mindhunter’ Review: An Extraordinary Crime Show That Reinvents Procedurals by Allison Keene October 17, 2017. I picked this book up to read the REAL story of John Douglas. There’s something compellingly off about him; he’s a milk-drinking straight arrow with a monomaniac streak that runs him afoul of department politics. “Mindhunter” doesn’t aestheticize or elevate the likes of Kemper. The reader made John come alive for me. If you are really into knowing what the mindset of serial killers are (just like the author was) then this book is totally for you. Please try again. Each of these iterations of Douglas’ persona focus on a man driven to find the motivation and habituation behind some of our country’s most gruesome murders in order to better understand how to catch other killers, or possibly even prevent these kinds of crimes from happening. There was an error retrieving your Wish Lists. When as a reader you're continuously losing your place on the page because your eyes keep rolling into the back of your head, it's time to put the book down. ), New cases, but a little too focused on Douglas himself, Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 16, 2016. Not sure why some reviewers say he is full of himself, I didn’t get that at all. It’s based on the memoir “Mindhunter: Inside the F.B.I.’s Elite Serial Crime Unit” by John Douglas and Mark Olshaker, and it can be stiff downloading the book’s ideas into dialogue. The only downside to this book is that the first 3 chapters are all context and background on the writer himself. Learn more about the program. By my estimation, it was written for members of the John Douglas fan club and anyone else who needs to know the minute details of his life. Your recently viewed items and featured recommendations, Select the department you want to search in. A biography catered to entertain, not educate, Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 28, 2018. Unable to add item to List. John is a real person with real problems he had to deal with. It is barely an exaggeration to say that pretty much every sentence in the first 100+ pages (that's how far I got before throwing in the towel) is crafted to show how amazingly smart, cool, brave, athletic and good-looking John Douglas is. Douglas has also been the model for a number of pop culture detectives, including Thomas Harris’ John Crawford, Will Graham of Hannibal, and FBI profilers on Criminal Minds. He recounts some of the cases he has dealt with, many of which are house old names such as Charles Manson and Ted Bundy and gives fascinating insights into the mind of a serial killer. There weren’t any twists to spoil, but the soft launch created an unnecessary shroud around what is now quietly one of the best series of the year. He is a man that is detail oriented and took notes. When a network hesitates to release more than one or two episodes, it’s usually a sign that they aren’t confident in the show, or there’s a major twist that they are protecting. The series is very much a boys’ club early on. The cases that Bill and Holden participate in helped bring killers to justice, which keeps the pace of the series taught and the narrative moving. You could probably finish it in just a couple days if you have nothing else going on.
