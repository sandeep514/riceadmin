In your summary, you say that Joan/Kat hunted Rose’s parents. It was shocking really. Now, like Cat, Joan is having visions of being shot by someone firing a rifle and hitting her shoulder.

But it is literally, the single most awkward dinner event that has ever taken place. Two girls (and a horned demon?) Finally, once this otherworldly being chooses her to do it’s dirty work she does so willingly and happily. Also, Rose did believe she was pregnant but there was a scene toward the end before she was killed where she was happy in the bathroom after she realized she got her period. This was nominated for "Best Storyline" at the British Soap Awards as well as  winning "Best Single Episode" in 2002. But the couple have received terrible news that their Madeleine is dead, after German police revealed they have evidence to prove it. Speaking of which, when Kat comes back, she finds Cat thrashing about in the boiler room for some reason. ), I was thinking that maybe Kat and Joan are the same people. We have zero context. Bill’s wife though? She believes that Satan or some demon is requesting the heads of the women. The actors performed a Nolan Sister's routine at the session, which was "later included on EastEnders as part of one of the Queen Vic's karaoke nights". First with regards to the name. Maybe she’s one of those “dark” emo kids who’s secretly all about death and doom and gloom. Oh yeah, she is crazy delusional. Following his murder, Zoe is led to believe that she killed Den – though Sam sees Chrissie kill Den and eventually tells Zoe, who punches Chrissie. Everything is more clear in bulleted lists! I don’t know if there were actual demons involved or if this girl was just very disturbed and lonely. I just watched it during this weekend. There are elements of a traditional devil/possession horror film present, but much of the way it is presented feels fresh. I appreciate your feedback and ideas. Soon, Mr. Gordon calls with news, and let’s everyone know he’s coming back to the school. It later emerges that Zoe is in fact Kat's daughter, born after Kat was raped by her uncle Harry (Michael Elphick), and was adopted by Kat's parents, Charlie and Viv.This was nominated for "Best Storyline" at the British Soap Awards as well as winning "Best Single Episode" in 2002. I’d like to think it was all just in her head too. Clive Barker reveals Nightbreed series on the way from Michael Dougherty. So much so, that he pulls out a photo of his lost daughter. hahaha. Although it had a few good moments. The first thing to understand about Blackcoat’s Daughter is that there are two threads. And it would appear that Cat is under the disillusion that she will be able to live there at the school with the headmaster. "[10] She claimed that the kiss was made easier due to the fact that she was kissing her off-screen best friend: "That made it so much easier. Thanks for this wonderful explanation. [11], In September 2004, a Christmas storyline created by Berridge that was to show Zoe fall pregnant with Dennis Rickman's (Nigel Harman) baby was axed by Berridge's successor, Kathleen Hutchison. I wasn't thrown into it and having Michelle has been great for me. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe and they become overemotional – and kiss. Basically so that we can all discuss what we think happened here. This film is the story of Katherine, Rose, and Joan. But here we are with Perkins first movie and debut. However once the thing leaves her wether because of the exorcism or it’s simply done with her she’s alone again. AITH Horror Vids of the Week: Astronaut's Wife, Freddy vs. Jason, UFO Show! When we meet her again it is years later and she has escaped the asylum and taken on the name Joan (they show her at one point with the stolen ID with that name on it). Well, because she looks exactly like his daughter, who, something bad happened to 9 years ago. What was that about? When Rose is instructed to care for Kat and denies Kat becomes upset because shes left alone. Kat arrives the next day to take Zoe home, but Roxy tries to prevent her taking Zoe, so Kat headbutts her. Everyone says I'm doing the right thing. KATE MCCANN revealed during a 2011 book on her daughter's disappearance that Maddie made a 'worrying' comment that left both her and Gerry 'puzzled' on the morning before she vanished. Perhaps also as a way to cope with the sudden feeling of abandonment she felt at losing her parents. I even watched it after the first couple loud proclamations. Anyway… this movie had some really good headjukes happening in it that even Perkins’ sophomore movie didn’t have. "Then Jessie [Wallace], who plays my screen mum Kat, said, 'You're young, so get out there. I really do like my freedom and jumping from job to job. There’s so many things incorrect about the description of this film I don’t even know where to start…. ( Log Out /  Alright! Is that how Kat succumbed to evil? Happens to me when I’m editing, and I change sentences and then and I miss a section. If you haven’t seen Westworld, go experience it for yourself and see if you can find what I am referring to. There were so many different things linking the two characters. Phil Collins's wife dumped him with ‘I’ve found someone else’ text, Moment Shannan Watts sent cops 'message about her murder from beyond the grave', Gemma Collins looks slimmer than ever after getting 'permanent contour' on her face, Philip Schofield puffs on cigarette during night out with pals, X Factor's Honey G shows off two stone weight loss and reveals she's a size 12, ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. Or she thought they would come this day because she kinda exchanged her’s and Rose’s parents ? When Kat shout by offer Priest exorcised demon against her will. I did love the chaos of the two story lines and the two different years being played out simultaneously. 				Change ), You are commenting using your Google account. Kat, meanwhile, has a premonitory dream of her parents dying in a car crash, and is unable to get ahold of them for an explanation of their tardiness. Over the course of the investigation, they have both been considered "persons of interest". Zoe is shell-shocked, and Kat slashes her wrists in despair. ), but also religious indoctrination (understandably so, as it is Catholic school), and although I don’t think we are meant to believe that God and Satan exist, we are meant to believe that the girls do, or at least Kat (Rose’s telling of the women at the school having no hair and worshiping the Devil being a typical school story told toungue in cheek, but also maybe to scare…), and that Kat, in her time of need, with the father figure of the school, on the side of God, also leaving, turns to a figure, Satan, she has been made to believe really exists, so why not turn to him (the possible confusion over who she wants as a father figure possibly springing from Satan being an OPPOSITE to God, but also an essential PART of the faith)……two things I misses somehow, Joan strangling someone, and seeing herself being shot, is it possible there are two cuts of the film???
