After Shannon is tied up for fear that he might hurt himself, Hannah is the only one he will speak to calmly. He believes he is followed by a “spook”—his past which haunts him. At the play’s end he is not healed nor are his circumstances altered—his last act is in fact to accept ruefully his condition, marked out for him by the person of the female hotel-owner, a woman of absolute appetite and primitive sensuality—acted with great gum-chewing, buttocks-wriggling, nasty elan by Bette Davis.

Style Told by a forty-year-old woman who has lived a life of celibacy while shepherding, on a nomadic, Vachel Lindsay-like existence, her aged grandfather, a minor poet who will read his work for coins and is fighting against failing powers to complete his last mysterious poem, a prayer for courage, the story constitutes a revelatory experience to set against the despair over the inexorability of erotic compulsion with which the play is otherwise largely concerned.

Costumes also define Maxine who wears a half-unbuttoned shirt when she first sees and tries to seduce Shannon. She tells him that she has had two encounters and has learned to accept what she cannot improve.
