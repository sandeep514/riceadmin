Jake admitted he used to be a narcissist but his illness changed him. It's hard to find time for any of it. This guy is his clone only my friend’s support system was finally exhausted and booted him back into the real world. So patient, kind and loving. Hi for those of you wondering MECFS (chronic fatigue syndrome), one of the illnesses in the series, is quite real and serious. There is evidence of autonomic system disruption. These people have mental health issues, and nothing more. Hi Jesse – Why does Bekah have to live in the desert? Many of commenters of this article  are appalled that anyone would dare suggest that these people who are clearly suffering, isolated, scared and in need of help could possibly be mentally ill. What if they are? ———————————————————————————————————————————————-, Mold Warriors by Dr Ritchie Shoemaker                                   Coming Soon. Positive vibes your way sister! They all can have something, or nothing. There is some kind of very strange (and I would bet sexually based) dysfunction in her life that necessitates her need for attention. But they need to go to a mental hospital not these quack ‘naturopaths’. If you can share in the #afflicted hashtag the following: MEpedia > ME/CFS https://www.me-pedia.org/wiki/ME/CFS You did a 180 on your own? Good stuff right here. Suddenly you can do everything that most living things do like exercise and go outside without any treatment? They  had no idea what to do with me and didn’t have the professional  capacity to spend enough time with me to really figure stuff out. I regularly get suspended for being an a$$hole, but someone has to call bullsh*t. I am constantly saying, ignore all these suggestions for “oil pulling” and follow what your doctor prescribed. Don’t let the tiles scare you away-the symptoms the person is exhibiting are, indeed, very real to them. I blame the eco nuts who go crazy about the end of the world to the point where mentally ill people are scared crapless. Carmen is very much like the Chuck character on Breaking Bad. Was mold the problem? Actually, there is plenty to support the physiology. Thousands of dollars for BS treatments. But then she steps out of the van in the middle of the desert, miles from anywhere, and says, “Something smells moldy.” Afflicted intentionally does this; juxtaposes the believable with the utterly ridiculous, the sincere accounts of spouses and significant others with doctors who you can just tell are stifling a scoff. But Shoemaker is exactly the sort of quack which is making his own patients look crazy by association. I would love to see Netflix pay for the therapy needed (mental health therapy, please) for these people and their families/loved ones. I have so much compassion for the individuals on this show and their struggles. I would love to know more backstory about Bekah’s boyfriend getting in to Harvard. I’m sure you do a lot of good. The other shame you fail to mention is the stigma that still surrounds the mentally ill. .” and I told him of the neurologist diagnosis. You seem to be very into backing all of this and these people, and you just changed one day ?…. Nonetheless Afflicted manages to be a pretty good film despite the fact that it doesn't reinvent the genre. They “dismiss recommendations by health providers” because mainstream medicine doesn’t help. We have worked so hard for people to even hear us out, and now we have this documentary that is portraying us as “mentally unstable.”. We will be recapping, This recap of The Right Stuff season 1, episode 3, “Single Combat Warrior”, contains spoilers. Nick, I am super curious to know if you (and the other individuals in this series) are happy with the way these illnesses were portrayed. The things people will do for a chance at human connection. I am praying that the ‘Afflicted’ team gets their act together and exhibits some altruism before it is too late as there is certainly enough guidance available in feedback for this “cast” already through various online media. Jamison couldn’t talk– it hurts him too much– but he obviously could eat as he was downright chunky for being restricted to a bed for years with muscle atrophy. This is completely inappropriate, as HLA types are closely connected to geographic/ethnic origins, and different rates simply reflected that he was treating patients with primarily Caucasian backgrounds. The manifestation of the limbic dysfunction then can appear as all these various conditions, EHS, MCS, CFS, Lyme, and so on. I invite you to consider that these folks are drawn to alternative treatments because nothing else is has worked for them. ), https://www.me-pedia.org/wiki/Myalgic_encephalomyelitis. Look at the ME movement – they are asking for MORE science. I think there is a reason that traditional medicine/therapy doesn’t work and its because there isn’t a real physical underlying cause. That they make comment without even attempting to look into the material that is available online to consider what could be happening, that there are so many amateur ‘psychologists’ that assume with no scientific basis that they have anything worthwhile adding to the discussion – is depressing.  I have been sick for 21 years. It seems that you are the one who has deep seeded issues that need addressing. She is hopeless and you can see it in her eyes. The below is hardly a “crazy echo chamber.”, The National Academy of Medicine: http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2015/ME-CFS.aspx Millions of people, at epidemic proportions, are having severe reactions and being disabled by chemicals, electromagnetism, and other environmental factors. The main problem is that it's clearly trying to be surprising and pulling "intelligent" twists here and there but it doesn't take a PhD on quantum physics to understand what's really going on here and since there's not much originality on the mythos it's exploring, it becomes kinda dreadful to endure at times, thanks to the overload of clichés and the lack of scares or subtetly. The fact that not a single CFS researcher had any intention of investigating the incident and circumstances that caused the CDC’s investigation to come to Lake Tahoe.                              | Top Critics (8) Carmen: paranoia, anxiety, somatization Even symptom management (for anxiety, sleep, pain) would go a long way, but usually no treatment is offered, not even this. The clinical trials you mention are dated and have been proven were flawed to have a psychological bias. Reach out and I will get you some info. Jamison’s case is at the very severe end of the spectrum. And there is nothing wrong with self education via the internet. Where there IS information available in “CFS Unraveled” by Dan Neuffer and other sources. Carmen and Bekah both show clear signs of someone who is a hypochondriac and those around them would be doing them a favor by no longer enabling their confusion and being bluntly honest with them and the illusion they have created within themselves. Her intention had only been to get out for a few hours, maybe for a long walk, and then return, but upon laying down in a neighbors doorway or on a park bench, she would lose all sense of time until the daylight woke her, but she meant no harm by any of this.

I also have a chronic illness that cannot be identified or cured – onset around 2011 after a severe bout with Mono, so I really understand how she feels. I am also blessed that I have doctors, nurses and specialists that know this is real. You also want me to believe that science is lagging behind you morons living in vans with no evidence to back your claims? There is no real evidence either way whether this is physical or psychologically based. Lyme put me in a wheelchair I had to self treat to get myself out of it. And how about some recovery stories in the program for crying out loud? He sent me to an oral surgeon. Verified reviews are considered more trustworthy by fellow moviegoers.
