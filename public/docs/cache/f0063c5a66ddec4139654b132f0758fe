Known for being a great actor and having played period characters, Saif Ali Khan seems ideal to essay the role. Her hair decoration is similar to a crown, and like Attina's and Triton's, has five points, although in a different style, representing that she is currently next in line to the throne after Attina.

Here's the official synopsis for those who might not be as familiar with this cult classic story: Fans of the animation – based on the Chinese legend The Ballad of Mulan – have been left both divided and curious ever since the first trailer for the 2020 film dropped. The plot follows rancher Wil Andersen, who has to recruit a crew of boys to help him drive his herd of cattle to sale when none of the local men will join him. Halle ...

Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote the first incarnation of "In the Heights" his sophomore year at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. Unfortunately, she died as a result of a run-in with a big pirate ship when Ariel was very young, fueling Triton's hatred of humans as a result.
