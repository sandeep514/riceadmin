If the believe what ever a few men as they call them Elders tell them to believe, this sounds like it's not a reglion but some sort of a organization. <br> <br>Might I submit that Jesus is not Just a loyal replacement as you said "in a sense" but He is the loyal sacrifice and substitute in the literal sense. According to the creation narrative in the first five chapters of the Book of Genesis, Adam is the first man created by God. First, I sense that you are a little frustrated because you keep repeating yourself. <br> <br>It is said that this act allowed the relationship between God and man to be restored. People should go and read about the history of the  JWs they will see what I've said to be true. Perhaps now you will be better able to understand the difference between a resurrected body and the human body you have now. (They also realised they’re nakedness because of a loss of innocence). And Adam, the first man, lay buried underneath, but when Jesus’ blood flowed onto him, he was resurrected. <br> <br>According to the creation narrative in the first five chapters of the Book of Genesis, Adam is the first man created by God. This war in heaven is also described again: [7] And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels. “When Jesus was crucified on top of the rock above us, his blood flowed down through a crack in the rock. When you begin studying the Bible, you will find that all spiritual forces use blood in various ways. <br> <br>[44] Another apostle, Franklin D. Richards, accepted the doctrine "that Adam is our Father and our God" as well, stating in a conference held in June 1854 that "the Prophet and Apostle Brigham has declared it, and that it is the word of the Lord". All rights reserved. <br> <br>All had their judgment day before the great Judge of the universe and all were sentenced to destruction. <br> <br>Adam was neither God nor the Only Begotten Son of God. The devil keeps this heresy alive as a means of obtaining converts to cultism. <br> <br>We will analyze the JW's view of blood and other doctrines. You exhibit love very openely and that is what I admire the most. We worship the Father, in the name of the Son, by the power of the Holy Ghost; and Adam is their foremost servant, by whom the peopling of our planet was commenced.[72]. "[65] "The doctrine preached and contended for by Father Edward Bunker of Bunkerville was investigated, condemned and Father Bunker set right. [47][verification needed] This hymn was not found in subsequent editions. This is a dangerous emotion that can send you to eternal hell. These things are so silly. I read the KJV and the NWT Bibles. <br> <br>Later, Adam returned to the Earth to the ancient prophets and to become the literal father of Jesus. [34] Then, reiterating, he said that "Jesus, our elder brother, was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the Garden of Eden, and who is our Father in Heaven. She said during the same documentary: “Well, the version of the story that ended up in the Book of Genesis seems to place the Garden of Eden somewhere in Mesopotamia. <br> <br>Click here for instructions on how to enable JavaScript in your browser. Where is the scriptural support for this teaching? With Christian love,Your brother, Mark. According to the JW point of view, when Adam died he would be acquitted from his sin because the Watchtower teaches that when we die our “slate” is cleaned -- so to speak. According to Christian tradition, the body of Adam was buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, directly below Calvery, also known as Golgotha –  the spot where Jesus was apparently crucified. <br> <br>[20] The spirits included Jesus, his firstborn, and Lucifer (the fallen angel who Mormons believe is Satan). A less open opposition to the doctrine may have been carried out by Mormon editors Samuel W. Richards and Franklin D. Richards who, according to one researcher, interpreted the idea of Adam being "our God" or "our Father" as meaning merely that Adam, as the first mortal man, stands at the head of the human family. I'm more than willing to discuss this with you further.Next, I agree with your second comment but please allow me to make an observation. However, the point of this article is, it seems clear that the Bible teaches that Adam and Eve will be, or at least have the potential to be resurrected into God‘s Kingdom. “And if you add ‘ah’ to the end, ‘adamah’ means land.”. <br> <br>The revelation comes after Dr Magness also claimed Adam’s burial answers the mystery of where the Garden of Eden may be located. I do not agree with the Watchtower's interpretation of Romans 6:7 because their understanding is completely out of context with the preceding verses. <br> <br>about whom holy men have written and spoken—He is our FATHER and our GOD, and the only God with whom WE have to do. At the end of his 1852 sermon, he stated, "Now, let all who may hear these doctrines, pause before they make light of them, or treat them with indifference, for they will prove their salvation or damnation. Hello my brother,My question was in regards to your article about Adam and Eve possibly having a resurrection. Asked if she believed that Adam was actually a metaphor for life as a whole, Dr Magness responded: “Well, yes – of course. <br> <br>For example, he stated that on the way to exaltation, one would have to "pass by" and "pay tribute to" various apostles and prophets, then Jesus, and "at length ... Father Adam. <br> <br>who according to the flesh is the only begotten as it is written. <br> <br>They will never have a conscious existence again, But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die, However, let this one fact not be escaping YOUR notice, beloved ones, that one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die, And I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. <br> <br>Likewise neither will Adam and Eve. Scripture does not say Adam cannot be forgiven and resurrected. <br> <br>I respect your understanding and appreciate your thoughts on this subject.With Christian love,Your Brother, Mark M. JEHOVAH clothed them with long clothing to attablish the proper way to dress, all i can say to you is MALACHI 3 VERSE 7 COME TO YOUR SENSES, also isaiah chapter 9 says jesus is the eternal father 1 corithians chapter 15 refers  to jesus the last adam he becomes in a sense the loyal replacement father we lost. He was a child of God in the spirit as we all are (see Acts 17:29). <br> <br>I have the same concern for you! I am open and willing to learn. Required fields are marked *. <br> <br>However, a serpent deceives the pair into eating a fruit from the forbidden tree and they are banished from the Garden of Eden by God, who curses them to a lifetime of hard labour, followed by death. Our High Priest (Hebrews 4:14). <br> <br>Why would you want the body your soul is living in now? Asked if she believed that Adam was actually a metaphor for life as a whole, Dr Magness responded: “Well, yes – of course. How can we conclude that this is speaking of the 144,000? <br> <br>No wonder people think the Bible is a fairy tale. Archaeologist Jodi Magness revealed during Morgan Freeman’s documentary “The Story of God”, how a discovery in the church’s wall led her to believe a key theory has been missed by religious followers. As far as Joseph’s tunic of many colors is concerned, this has nothing to do with Adam and Eve being resurrected. You receive a eternal body the moment you die. Since the blood type of a child comes from the father’s seed, Christ’s blood would not have been linked to His earthly father, Joseph, but it was directly connected to God Himself. [24] To bear mortal children, Adam and Eve had to take on mortal bodies. [25], Then, the doctrine teaches that after his mortal existence, Adam returned to his throne and reigned as the immortal God of this Earth. I may be wrong, but I sense anger in your comments. Mark thank you for this very informative discussion. First, he was a creator god. So you see, Eve just didn’t eat an apple off a tree; she and Adam actually gave dominion of the earth to satan. “Adam was the first human and, in Hebrew, the word ‘Adam’ means ‘man’. Not one of us deserve to go to Heaven which is why we have the shedding of Jesus Christ’s innocent “blood” for the remission of our sins. But with the surrender of the glorious principle of Celestial Marriage—a union for time and eternity—came darkness, mental drowsiness, a detour from the Gospel path, until all sorts of speculation pertaining to the plan of Salvation was indulged in.[74]. Pratt continued to debate the issue in public forums for months, despite being rebuked privately and publicly by Young on more than one occasion (Bergera 1980, pp. He was not begotten by the Holy Ghost. <br> <br>And having so determined, they soon are ready to enter polygamous relationships that destroy their souls. According to Young, he was taught by Joseph Smith[2] that Adam is "our Father and our God, and the only God with whom we have to do."[3]. <br> <br>You have cited Malachi 3:7 more than once in our conversation. Archaeologist Jodi Magness revealed during Morgan Freeman’s documentary “The Story of God”, how a discovery in the church’s wall led her to believe a key theory has been missed by religious followers. I sincerely hope that the understanding God has given me in order to write this article is beneficial to your life. Also, if you truly believe the JW teaching of Romans 6:7, (Which I do not) then you would have to accept that Adam would have be resurrected. <br> <br>Although the doctrine is rejected by the LDS Church today, it is still an accepted part of the modern theology of some Mormon fundamentalists. Here are just a few: 1. Man created religion where as Jehovah God wanted solely a bond between He and His people. Records of the meeting state that Bunker was corrected: "Pres Woodruff and Cannon showed ... that Adam was an immortal being when he came to this earth and was made the same as all other men and Gods are made. He lived nearly a thousand years. <br> <br>When Adam sinned, we all went down with him, but when Jesus was resurrected, we all were resurrected with Him; and, if we believe and accept this, we will all live with Him forever. Mark thank you. I say they are an organization not a bible base sort of church if you will. Unfortunately, I do not know how many miles Nod is located east of Eden. <br> <br>Instead, the majority of the population has been programmed by satan and the dark spiritual forces to think of the Garden of Eden as a fairy tale. Soon after Brigham Young died, the Adam–God doctrine fell out of favor within the LDS Church and was replaced by a theology more similar to Pratt's, as expounded by turn-of-the century Mormon theologians James E. Talmage, B. H. Roberts, and John A. Widtsoe. <br> <br>The name Malachi is translated from Hebrew to mean “My Messenger.” This is very likely a shortened form of the Hebrew “Mal’akya” which literally means “Messenger of Jehovah.” Malachi was used by Jehovah to bring a message of Judgment to a people plagued with corrupt priests, wicked practices and a false sense of security in their relationship with God. My love for you is unconditional regardless of what you believe. <br> <br> <br>They were condemned because they were not keeping all of Jehovah’s Commandments. They will not lead you astray, but will direct you into paths of truth and salvation.[73]. In the second narrative, Adam is placed in the Garden of Eden alongside Eve – his companion – and told they can eat freely of the garden, except from, Apocalypse SOLVED? That first man sent his own Son to redeem the world. <br> And they believe they are doing God's work and that is admirable. Jesus said: Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. ... God had only one begotten son in the flesh. The lineage of Michael/Adam, which includes all but Jesus on this Earth, will never become saviors of worlds. <br>";s:7:"keyword";s:32:"adam resurrected by jesus' blood";s:5:"links";s:9154:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/death-stranding-characters-86e6ec'>Death Stranding Characters</a>,
