For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons. Lethargians: Do? The Phantom Tollbooth We always see things from the same angle … It's much less trouble that way. Now add one to it. What's the use of subtracting turnips from turnips, or carrying a three, or knowing how to spell 'Feb-uary?' You must never feel badly about making mistakes. In the process, he learns valuable lessons, finding a love of learning. Each quote represents a book that is Expectations is the first location that Milo reaches on his journey and already he is starting to learn some important lessons. “The Phantom Tollbooth”, p.190, Knopf Books for Young Readers, Norton Juster (2011). Milo: Well if you can't laugh or think, what can you do in the doldrums?                                     ― Norton Juster, quote from The Phantom Tollbooth, “Everybody is so terribly sensitive about the things they know best.” I haven't been doing anything. Humbug: Nonsense! There, you see?                                     ― John Steinbeck, quote from Of Mice and Men. Each one is different, you know, and all very beautiful if you listen carefully.” Why, when a housefly flaps his wings, a breeze goes round the world; when a speck of dust falls to the ground, the entire planet weighs a little more; and when you stamp your foot, the earth moves slightly off its course. The Terrible Trivium: Of course. Lethargians: Stop that at once! I imagine by now it's quite rusty.”, “Everybody is so terribly sensitive about the things they know best.”, “if something is there, you can only see it with your eyes open, but if it isn't there, you can see it just as well with your eyes closed. "In other words--""You mean you have other words?"                                     ― Norton Juster, quote from The Phantom Tollbooth, “Whether or not you find your own way, you're bound to find some way. Gelatinous Giant: And what have we here? "But I could never have done it," he objected, "without everyone else's help." This page was last edited on 9 August 2019, at 03:52.   	Quotes By Norton Juster. Or perhaps you know the silence when you haven't the answer to a question you've been asked, or the hush of a country road at night, or the expectant pause of a room full of people when someone is just about to speak, or, most beautiful of all, the moment after the door closes and you're alone in the whole house? Lethargians: And you weren't paying attention either. White, quote from Charlotte's Web, “Can’t repeat the past?…Why of course you can!” I'm the Dodecahedron, and who are you? ...it's very much like your trying to reach infinity. Demon of Insincerity: For I'm the long-nosed, curly-haired, wide-mouthed, thick-necked, broad-shouldered, round-bodied, short-armed bow-legged big-footed monster! We're in a hurry. Useful too for 'Good morning,' 'Good afternoon,' 'Good evening,' 'Good riddance,' and 'Good-bye!'. Whenever you laugh, gladness spreads like the ripples in the pond; and whenever you're sad, no one anywhere can be really happy. Discord! Oh, I can sting, but I don't. The story is a modern-day fairy tale about a bored boy named Milo who drives through a magic tollbooth and into a new and very different world.                                      And when the Mathemagician claimed that numbers were much more important than words, and hence his kingdom was supreme, why then naturally the asked the princess of Sweet Rhyme and the princess of Pure Reason to settle the question. “I can’t do any of those things,” admitted Milo. “SILENCE,” suggested the King. I'm the WHETHER Man, not the Weather Man!                                      The Tollbooth: Results are not guaranteed, but if not perfectly satisfied, your wasted time will be refunded. There are so many things to take away, and things to bring back! Whether Man: Well now, well now, well now - if it isn't the little boy who got lost trying to find his way. 2 pages at 400 words per page) All the great books of the past, and all the ones yet to come are in that bag. Laughing is against the law! The MathemaGician: Rescue Rhyme and Reason? Could you tell me the right road to... Dictionopolis, or someplace? That’s the shortest sentence I know.”. “Now, young man, what can you do to entertain us? Faintly Macabre: Well of course there is. Whether Man: Whether or not you find your way, you're bound to find some way! The MathemaGician: Very well, Sir Humbug. Expect everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens.                                  This quotation comes from Faintly Macabre's account of the history of the Lands Beyond in Chapter 6. Now you had to go and spoil everything! You did say it was going to rain - didn't you? "You know what I could do? Dungeons are always dark. You couldn't have three blind mice without the mice, could you? It’s really quite simple: every time you decide something without having a good reason, you jump to Conclusions whether you like it or not.                                      Tock: It's about time? A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G. Let us know what’s wrong with this preview of, “So many things are possible just as long as you don't know they're impossible.”, “Expect everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens.”, “Have you ever heard the wonderful silence just before the dawn?                                     ― Norton Juster, quote from The Phantom Tollbooth, “The only thing you can do easily is be wrong, and that's hardly worth the effort.” 254 quotes from Norton Juster: 'So many things are possible just as long as you don't know they're impossible. asked Milo politely. Here I am driving down a street I've never seen to a place I've never heard of.                                     ― Norton Juster, quote from The Phantom Tollbooth, “Would it be possible for me to see something from up there?" “The Phantom Tollbooth”, p.95, Knopf Books for Young Readers, Norton Juster (2011). And it's much the same thing with knowledge, for whenever you learn something new, the whole world becomes that much richer. But it's not just learning that's important.                                      B-E-E-S, bees. "That's why," said Azaz, "there was one very important thing about your quest that we couldn't discuss until you returned. Things which are just as bad also are equally good. You're the Terrible Trivium! For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons.” Tell stories? Everybody says it's such a big, wonderful world. Milo: And what did they decide? Officer Short Shrift: Of course it's dark.                                                                                     Born place: in New York, New York, The United States Do you think it will rain? Like the Whether Man. The MathemaGician: Never, for the number you hope for is always at least one higher than the one you had, and that's so large that if you started saying it yesterday, you wouldn't finish until tomorrow. It seems to me that almost everything is a waste of time. Here’s one that’s very good.” He handed it to Milo and, through the icing and nuts, Milo saw that it said “THE EARTH IS FLAT.”                                     ― Norton Juster, quote from The Phantom Tollbooth, “if something is there, you can only see it with your eyes open, but if it isn't there, you can see it just as well with your eyes closed.
