And still it's actually much more terrifying and oppressive. She is taken in by her neighbors. There is a great story and this would be such an easy movie for any other country to take, and make there own as we see them do. The story does deal with a very serious and disturbing subject however, so this movie may not be appropriate for everyone. In a nutshell: give it a break - watch the news instead. Easily one of the best horror movies 2013. Dark Touch takes the audience into an uncomfortable place, one with psychologically disturbing ground. I watched this at the Fantasy Film Festival in Stuttgart and the director was attending. Get ready for creepy! Una pelicula Que el tema del que habla es una verdad. Throughout, we only get closer to the injustices imparted upon (and within) Naimh. To help ease her trauma, dutiful neighbors Nat and Lucas take her in with the supervision of a social worker. The story is stupid and the acting is horrible.The story of a little girl who gets raped by his parents is okay but the fact that she can move objects with her mind is really weird and unrealistic but it's entertaining.But,the worst part is the end they just burn. It dabbles in the matter of child abuse with stylish yet subtle approach, but the slow pacing and lack of resolve might deter some viewers.

Dark Touch shows us that real horror is in us humans. It does what great horror films do, connect reality with fear. Metacritic Reviews. That space between reality and mirage is where Ms. de Van’s strength, and this movie’s true horror, lies. In a remote country home in Ireland, 11 year old Neve(Missy Keating) is the soul survivor of a bloody massacre. Dark Touch isn’t out to scare its audience with any fantastical ghouls — the film’s demons are very real, only portayed via supernatural elements to enhance and sharpen their potency onscreen. This is because, as the film strives to prove, there is never a moment of escape for the children who suffer abuse. The film’s heroine is an 11-year-old girl named Niamh (Missy Keating), who comes to live with her neighbors Lucas and Natalie Galin (Padraic Delaney and Marcella Plunkett) after her parents are killed in a supernatural mêlée, instigated by Niamh. Dark, gritty movie. The rest speaks for it's self. Well acted, atmospheric, and more than a little unsettling. Dark, gritty movie. Decent, if hard to watch. The best horror cinema uses the supernatural to shine a light on the real life horrors of this world, Marina de Van's portrait of an abused child's psyche is disturbingly realistic and deeply unsettling. I totally do NOT understand the good reviews. It does what great horror films do, connect reality with fear. ), You've heard of "Insidious:, well this movie should have been called "Atrocious". The supernatural elements only becomes the allegory of her feelings against the violence she faces at home. Neve keeps repeating that the house did it. Albeit in an extremely violent fashion. This was a creepy, beautifully filmed and incredibly sad little indie horror film. Eventually, in a metaphor for the ceaseless cycle of abuse, Niamh uses her powers to transform her adult targets into helpless children, forcing them through all of the physical and sexual tortures and traumas she experienced at the hands of her parents… but not before bringing the lot of her judgmental classmates to their demise. There is never a moment in Dark Touch free of tension, never a release from the pangs felt by the tragic heroine. © 2020 CBS Interactive Inc.

It dabbles in the matter of child abuse with stylish yet subtle approach, but the slow pacing and lack of resolve might deter some viewers. The tale of Niamh (in the move it sounds as though they are saying Neve) and the sexual molestation and child abuse she deals with is chilling. However, this endeavor is probably not one audience would like to take part of. Man is the cruelest animal. I'm very disappointed--yet not surprised--by so many of these bad reviews. In a remote town in Ireland, eleven-year-old Niamh finds herself the sole survivor of a bloody massacre that killed her parents and younger brother. This is a low-budget movie compared with a blockbuster like "The Conjuring".     |                         Easily one of the best horror movies 2013. In a concept that will ring familiar to Stephen King fans, preteen Niamh provokes objects to move, fly, crash, and shatter when she is emotionally rattled. However--and this is as generous as I can be towards the "it was stupid, it was boring, too slow, nothing happens, etc etc" simplistic complaints I've read--this movie confronts a brutal reality that is understandably difficult for many people to face: the physical and sexual abuse of children. And yet, Dark Touch seems to reside almost completely in a realm of fantasy that isn’t Neve’s own and borders perilously and atonally on camp, as the girl’s perception of the film’s adults as monsters seems corroborated at every turn by their erratic behaviors and the telling photographs they don’t exactly keep under lock and key. The darkness brewing inside Niamh, her unwanted psychic powers, is forever with her — she can’t hide from this curse, can’t turn it off. This film is worth seeing not only for its plot and technical aspects but also for the entire cast, made up almost entirely of Irish actors. As was the truth with this movie as well. Kind of unravels at the end though. Carrie, even at its darkest, is watchable, fun, removed — a classic fitting snugly in the margins of the genre. It shows what horrors a child abuse victim goes through, how their innocence is lost. Well the movie does have an alluring poster / cover, but as the saying goes; don't judge a book by its cover. Actually, the horror of this film is a reflection of the true horror of everyday life, namely child abuse. The film isn't a harrowing encounter, at least. External Reviews buenos efectos eso si y te mantiene atento a saber que es lo que quiere hacer la principal de la pelicula, The 25 Best Console Launch Games (Since 2000). I sincerely hope Missy Keating will think of another career - maybe stack shelves at Tesco, or become a carer, or a dentist clinic receptionist (once they solve the breathing problem). Nobody believes her about the mysterious powers of the house. If you like your horror more nuanced, less obvious, if you judge a film by the amount of discussion it generates afterward you'll like this one. Except maybe: How did no one hear the girl screaming if only the neighbor heard the noise. Suspecting a gang of homicidal vandals, the police ignore Neve's explanation that the house is the culprit. Dark Touch takes the audience into an uncomfortable place, one with psychologically disturbing ground. It’s about deeper fears, and realer monsters. The film isn't a harrowing encounter, at least not in usual adrenaline rush inducing way of horror or mystery genre, it's more of a thoughtful process to instill doubt and sympathy. Check box if your review contains spoilers, In a remote town in Ireland, eleven-year-old Niamh finds herself the sole survivor of a bloody massacre that killed her parents and younger brother. While Carrie manages quite a deal of psychologial weight thanks to the title character’s struggles with her belittling schoolmates and hostile and delusional mother, nothing in the Brian de Palma classic holds a candle to the severity of Dark Touch. Neve has trouble finding peace with the wholesome and nurturing couple, and horrific danger continues to manifest. If you are a fan of Suspense/Horror not the jumpy jolty horror the deeper stuff that needs to be ripped to the surface, then you will most likely want to check this movie out. Although being extremely dark and very disturbing, at a certain level, it is entertaining although horrifying. Tribeca’s child abuse horror veers from these motifs, providing not the standard entertaining escape, but instead a plaguing, probing inspection of the apocalyptic damages of the crimes exhibited therein. User Ratings Nothing could be farther from the truth! At first it appears strangely incoherent, yet it pulled me in because of its flawless cinematography, outstanding, moody, ominous lighting and a fantastic protagonist, young Missy Keating who at the time of the release was 12 years old. Awards The start would be OK if it hadn't been overexploited in similarly pedestrian movies of the same genre. The pacing was spot on. This is worth a watch, albeit not without it's flaws. She finds strange occurrences continue to follow her and thinks that they are the results of her own tears. To see the physical abuse manifest into a psychic ability of self-defense is astounding. Thanks to Hollywood, the word “horror” has taken on a connotation that’s a far leap from its dictionary definition. This isn't once again about demons who must be fought with ancient rituals and religious symbolism. As such, you’re not really finding true horror in any of these romps through the valleys of schadenfreude. At first she is afraid of the strange power she has discovered in herself but by the end of the film she has become its master and uses it for the cataclysmic end. The actress who plays the abused child is well remembered and captures your attention completely. … Expand The film isn't a harrowing encounter, at least not in usual adrenaline rush inducing way of horror or mystery genre, it's more of a thoughtful process to instill doubt and sympathy. After watching this film, most people would probably say something like, "There was a lot of potential and the beginning was truly immersing but then the story lost all its energy and did not recover for the rest of the film." One of the best horror movies of 2013. Those people would be wrong. The nurturing couple do all they can to help Neve overcome the tragedy; but something dangerous and evil is ready to attack again. The plot is predictable. Please enter your birth date to watch this video: You are not allowed to view this material at this time. I think she had the ability to sense the true intent in people regardless of the face they showed the rest of the world. But de Van’s goal is the utilization of otherworldly elements as a vehicle for delivering a real, grounded, important subject with as powerful a bite as possible. When you speak of a horror movie, you speak of roller coaster thrills and sadistic pleasures — the genre might not be lauded critically, but it reigns supreme in the film industry’s output of fun. It dabbles in the matter of child abuse with stylish yet subtle approach, but the slow pacing and lack of resolve might deter some viewers.
