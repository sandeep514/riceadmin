Two ships would be lost; dozens of men would never return. ", Nantucket had created an economic system that no longer depended on the island's natural resources. The sperm whale might be faster and more aggressive than the right whale, but it was far more enriching. On the corner of Main and Pleasant Streets was the Friends' immense South Meeting House, built in 1792 from pieces of the even bigger Great Meeting House that once loomed over the stoneless field of the Quaker Burial Ground at the end of Main Street. The town that Thomas Nickerson knew had a ramshackle feel about it. Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2015. Whaleboats were quickly dispatched. Where a person lived in Nantucket depended on his station in the whaling trade. Her oldest living daughter was eight years old; her only son was not yet two. Quakers or, more properly, members of the Society of Friends, depended on their own experience of God's presence, the "Inner Light," for guidance rather than relying on a Puritan minister's interpretation of scripture. Instead of building fancy houses or buying fashionable clothes, Nantucket's Quakers reinvested their profits in the whale fishery. The first words a baby was taught included the language of the chase—"townor," for instance, a Wampanoag word meaning that the whale has been sighted for a second time. These visits involved more than the exchange of mere gossip. While many of the attendees were there for the good of their souls, those in their teens and early twenties tended to have other motives. In the summer of 1819 people were still talking about the time when, nine years earlier, a pod of right whales was spotted to the north of the island. The other strike against Moby-Dick was that it was, for the mid-nineteenth century, a very unconventional and challenging novel. Speaking before a group assembled in the Starbucks' living room, Richardson succeeded in moving Mary to tears. Just a moment while we sign you in to your Goodreads account. Such was not the case. The book discusses a few potential reasons why the whale attacked the Essex. Throughout the seventeenth century, English Nantucketers resisted all attempts to establish a church on the island, partly because a woman by the name of Mary Coffin Starbuck forbade it. With their men gone for so long, Nantucket's women were obliged not only to raise the children but also to run many of the island's businesses. This is another book that I was introduced to because I saw the film first. His gravestone read: Crush'd as the moth beneath thy hand We moulder to the dust Our feeble powers can ne'er withstand And all our beauty's lost. Finally, after what had seemed an endless wait, Nickerson was going to sea. Perphaps no community before or since has been so divided by its commitment to work. What's next for you? He wasn't going alone. Since the normal rule is that the person writing the closest to the actual event is the most trustworthy, that means that Chase's account should be given precedence. The unhappy truth was that while Nickerson's mother, Rebecca Gibson, was a Nantucketer, his father, Thomas Nickerson, had been from Cape Cod, and Thomas Junior had been born in Harwich in 1805. You brought a historic tale to life with vivid detail and emotional content that rivals narrative fiction. This may have been their closest bond: each of them, like so many Nantucketers, was a fatherless child for whom a ship's officer would be much more than a demanding taskmaster; he would be, quite possibly, the first male authority figure the boys had ever known. This creature, Hussey quickly realized, was a sperm whale, one of which had washed up on the island's southwest shore only a few years before. In a speech before Parliament in 1775, the British statesman Edmund Burke looked to the island's inhabitants as the leaders of a new American breed—a "recent people" whose success in whaling had exceeded the collective might of all of Europe. Almost from the very beginning, the author spins together letters, partially-written accounts and log book entries-- along with his own research-- into a tale that is difficult to put down.

The unhappy truth was that while Nickerson's mother, Rebecca Gibson, was a Nantucketer, his father, Thomas Nickerson, had been from Cape Cod, and Thomas Junior had been born in Harwich in 1805. Lots of revealing detail about the community of Nantucket, the construction of the ships, how the crews were assembled of novice and veteran whalers, the sheer enormity of the task of finding, killing, rendering whales and sailing these relatively small, relatively fragile ships thousands of miles into unknown waters. There was rumored to be a secret society of young women on the island whose members pledged to marry only men who had already killed a whale.  You're listening to a sample of the Audible audio edition. It was said that nothing of consequence was done on Nantucket without Mary's approval. His other books includeAway Off Shore: Nantucket Island and Its People, 1602-1890 and Abram's Eyes: The Native American Legacy on Nantucket Island. Living on an island that was almost the same distance from the mainland as England was from France, Nantucketers developed a British sense of themselves as a distinct and superior people, privileged citizens of what Ralph Waldo Emerson called the "Nation of Nantucket.". The Essex might not look like much, stripped of her rigging and chained to the wharf, but for Thomas Nickerson she was a vessel of opportunity. I really enjoyed this book!! Pacifist killers, plain-dressed millionaires, the whalemen of Nantucket were simply fulfilling the Lord's will. Somehow I'd never noticed them before, and if I had, I'd resisted the tendency to say, "Wow!" This may have been their closest bond: each of them, like so many Nantucketers, was a fatherless child for whom a ship's officer would be much more than a demanding taskmaster; he would be, quite possibly, the first male authority figure the boys had ever known. Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex (Movie Tie-in) But even within this close-knit familial community, there were distinctions, and Thomas Nickerson was on the outside looking in. I therefore picked up this book with mixed feelings but I need not have worried. Their first boats were only twenty feet long, and they launched them from the beaches along the island's south shore. Something went wrong. Where information concerning the Essex and her crew was lacking, I turned to other whaling voyages for examples of what had occurred under similar circumstances. Just because they were "superior wives" didn't mean that the island's women were without normal physical desires. After viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in. Mott, who eventually moved to Philadelphia, commented on how odd such a practice would have struck anyone from the mainland, where the sexes operated in entirely different social spheres. In the Heart of the Sea (Young Readers Edition). What are these and which do you believe to be true? I was so bored. There she sounds through the window!". However, Chase was an officer attempting to put some very bad decisions in the best possible light. Just because they were "superior wives" didn't mean that the island's women were without normal physical desires. One anecdote about my starvation research: In December, a week or so before Christmas 1998, my wife stopped by our local library to pick up a copy of an article I'd ordered through Interlibrary Loan. It wasn't until about three months later, in December of 1997, that I was able to turn my undivided attention to the Essex. This is the true story of the sinking of the whale ship Essex by an 80 ton sperm whale in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in 1820. Nantucket was a town of roof dwellers. The mother happened into the room just as the terrified pet attempted to escape, and unsure of what she had found herself in the middle of, she picked up the cotton ball. Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2016. What is surprising is how rarely Nantucketers, even young and adventurous Nantucketers like Nickerson and company, strayed beyond the gates of the little town. I came away from my three-hour ramble through what is an old candle factory stuffed with a fascinating assortment of artifacts with a renewed sense of the size and strength of the whale. No matter how much the inhabitants might try to hide it, there was a savagery about this island, a bloodlust and pride that bound every mother, father, and child in a clannish commitment to the hunt. If he was a shipowner or merchant, he more than likely lived on Pleasant Street, set back on the hill, farthest from the clamor and stench of the wharves. Once they'd killed the whale, they towed it back to the beach, where they removed the blubber and boiled it into oil. Did these differences contribute to the demise of the Essex or the eventual loss of lives? --Sebastian Junger, author of The Perfect Storm. If you should wish to see any man, you need but ask the first inhabitant you meet, and he will be able to conduct you to his residence, to tell what occupation he is of, and any other particulars you may wish to know.". The houses were shingled and unpretentious and, as often as not, included items scavenged from ships. It began in the summer of 1997. What criteria did you use to delineate between reliable and unreliable sources? "Fascinating...One of our country's great adventure stories...when it comes to extremes, In the Heart of the Sea is right there. Current price is $15.99, Original price is $18. In a world of whales, sea serpents, and ominous signs in the night sky, all Nantucketers, whalemen and landsmen alike, looked to the town as a sanctuary, a fenced-in place of familiar ways and timeless ancestral alliances, a place to call home. But, everlasting God, thou dost ordain That we, poor feeble mortals should engage (Ourselves, our wives and children to maintain), This dreadful monster with a martial rage. When tragedy strikes, the descriptions manage to get even more in depth. (In subsequent decades, as their ambitions required greater space and visibility, these worthies would gravitate toward Main Street). Instead of toasting a person's health, a Nantucketer offered invocations of a darker sort: Death to the living, Long life to the killers, Success to sailors' wives And greasy luck to whalers. Two-wheeled, horse-drawn carts known as calashes continually came and went. Goodreads helps you keep track of books you want to read. In old age, Nickerson still visited the graves of his parents in the Old North Burial Ground. "[N]o sooner have they undergone this ceremony," said Crèvecoeur, "than they cease to appear so cheerful and gay; the new rank they hold in the society impresses them with more serious ideas than were entertained before.... [T]he new wife ... gradually advises and directs [the household]; the new husband soon goes to sea; he leaves her to learn and exercise the new government in which she is entered.". But factors besides Quakerism and a common heritage also drove the Nantucket psyche—in particular, an obsession with the whale. Nantucket's large Wampanoag population had been reduced to a handful by epidemics, forcing shipowners to look to the mainland for crew. What was most interesting to me was the story of how the crew dealt with the event, their tenacity, ability to endure enormous suffering, and willingness to follow leaders, even leaders with very different skill sets. San Francisco Chronicle, "Nathaniel Philbrick has taken one of the most horrifying stories in maritime history and turned it into a classic....One of the most chilling books I have ever read." Philbrick was Brown’s first Intercollegiate All-American sailor in 1978; that year he won the Sunfish North Americans in Barrington, RI; today he and his wife Melissa sail their Beetle Cat Clio and their Tiffany Jane 34 Marie-J in the waters surrounding Nantucket Island.
