They compared the DNA sample to Bobby Dunbar’s younger brother Alonzo. Was the boy found by Louisiana authorities really Bobby? The Dunbars were an ordinary young family, with Percy and Lessie doting on their two children and working hard to fulfill their every need. If this case or the research into it interests you, I highly recommend listening to Margaret Dunbar Cutright, Tal McThenia and the Dunbar and Anderson families on This American Life. However, the disappointment was inevitable. “When Emily’s profile came into the database, she was connected to Walter and Freda in such a way that it could have only been Walter and Freda,” said D’Anna. Anderson hesitated to say that the boy in Mississippi was Bruce at first, but eventually stated that he was, in fact, her son. That’s when she decided to investigate. It will always be remembered as a decade of struggle and poverty. He said that the woman, Julia Anderson, had given him custody of the boy. Walters was tried for kidnapping. In 2004, DNA test results proved that the child returned to the Dunbars was, in fact, not Bobby. . But both women were diligent researches and equally committed to discovering the truth about their family histories, even if it contradicted what they thought they knew. Other Dunbars were furious at Margaret for going digging, with some blindsided by the fact the test was done. Her claims to the child were dismissed. At that moment Elliott felt like the world no longer tethered her to the ground and felt completely uprooted. When the boy arrived, the parents should have been thrilled. What finally broke Margaret, however, was an item from someone completely unrelated to either party. D’Anna would continue to investigate, but it wasn’t until 2017, when D’Anna attended a storytelling platform, that he met DNA genealogist, Bonnie Belza. Walters was convicted of kidnapping in a sensational trial, but the verdict was overturned on appeal. “We were family,” she said.                          JavaScript is required for full functionality on this website, but scripting is currently disabled. He was traveling with a boy matching Bobby Dunbar’s description. Thanks to Dodds’ help, he was able to find the answers Elliott needed. More than likely, he was the illegitimate son of Walters’ brother and a servant living with Walters’ parents. Although her children indicated that her life was a happy one after settling in Poplarville, they said that she nonetheless spoke often of her lost son and that their family always regarded him as having been kidnapped by the Dunbars. </p> <p>Luckily, Elliott found not just her birth parents, but a great-grandniece to boot. Margaret believes he most likely fell into the Swayze Lake during the fishing trip and was eaten by an alligator. Authorities and locals searched tirelessly for the Dunbar child. At the time, the story of the Lindbergh kidnapping swept the nation, making the case relevant once more. Gathering the information he already had at hand, D’Anna thought it was time to show Elliott his findings. Photos in a 1914 newspaper of a confirmed Bobby Dunbar before he was lost (left) and the boy who was found later (right). The court sided with the Dunbars and Walters was sentenced to time in jail for kidnapping. His description went out:  4 year old, Caucasian male, blond, blue eyes with a mole on his neck and a burn scar on his big toe. The results showed that Dunbar, Jr. was not related by blood to his supposed cousin, the son of Alonzo Dunbar who was the younger brother of Bobby Dunbar, Sr.[6] Since the DNA testing is conclusive, the fate of the real Bobby Dunbar remains unknown. Then in the early 2000s one of Bobby’s granddaughters, Margaret Dunbar Cutright started looking into her family’s history. Unlike today, where finding out about our ancestry is as simple as spitting in a tube, back in 1988, the concept was underdeveloped and restricted. However, throughout her journey, she faced a lot of closed doors from her biological parents’ family. Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email. This is a farce. The boy returned to Opelousas with the Dunbars to a parade, with much fanfare celebrating the "homecoming.". A retrial was ordered by the state supreme court, but the case was dropped because it was deemed too expensive. ( Log Out /  </p> <p>It was the piece of the puzzle that could finally answer the decades-old question and forever reshape the Dunbar family history. However, since her cousins were from such a focused area, there was an issue of intermarriage, or what Belza called in genealogical terms. Then, in April of 1913, they found a boy matching Bobby’s description in Mississippi with a man named William Cantwell Walters. D’Anna was 100% certain that he had found Elliott’s parents. You are wrong…it is very likely I will lose my life. The woman was brought to Mississippi and identified the child as Charlie Bruce Anderson, but a court-appointed arbiter ruled that he was the Dunbars… </p> <p>The more they dug into the open sore that was their family history, however, the more they drifted apart. So, what really happened to Bobby Dunbar? And while the identity of the boy who had been traveling with Walters had been officially confirmed, there were still unanswered questions. Other newspaper accounts quote both the Dunbars as initially stating doubts as to the boy's identity. “I actually had to wind up going to court myself, and I actually represented myself in front of a judge,” D’Anna said reflectively. He was incarcerated for two years before his attorney could obtain an appeal. “I think she had to have, on some level, known,” began Margaret. Elliott had a past and she lived a life that gave her love regardless. </p> <p>In 2004, after an Associated Press reporter approached the family about the story, Bob Dunbar, Jr. consented to undergoing DNA tests to resolve the issue. With tensions gradually mounting, eventually a full-blown feud between the two families erupted. He swore up and down the boy wasn’t Bobby, but Bruce Anderson, the son of a woman who worked for his family and who agreed to allow him to take Bruce with him on his travels. He was convinced solely on Dodd’s connection to the Roths. However, her descendants said she never stopped talking about the son she had lost. Walters was arrested. Kidnapping in the state of Louisiana was a capital offense. However, after carefully inspecting the boy for identifying marks, the Dunbars were able to positively identify the child as their little Bobby. Leaving their hometown of Opelousas, Louisiana, the family headed to Swayze Lake for a well-deserved vacation. Anderson and Walters maintained the boy was Bruce Anderson for the rest of their lives. It wasn’t easy. </p> <p>Walters was arrested. It wasn’t uncommon for newlyweds or couples to abandon their children during the time. Is it the goriness? </p> <p>                       [1] In August 1912, the Dunbars took a fishing trip to nearby Swayze Lake in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana. However, upon closer inspection, she said with confidence that the boy was hers. Dodds understood that her birth parents wanted to keep their lives separate from hers and in the end, sent them a certificate to thank them for giving her a second chance at life. After all, he was very young when this all transpired. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:31:"bruce anderson and bobby dunbar";s:5:"links";s:4688:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/muggsy-bogues-manute-bol-86e6ec'>Muggsy Bogues Manute Bol</a>,
