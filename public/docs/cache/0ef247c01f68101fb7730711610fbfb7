He will probably pick up the backing of some of Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters who previously cast aspersions on Ms. Loeffler’s nomination, like the Fox News host Sean Hannity.

But Loeffler chose to make her critique of Romney as public as possible -- and by tagging the President in the tweet, did everything she could to ensure he saw it. Copyright © 2020 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved. After all, Loeffler could have very easily asked to speak with Romney off the Senate floor to tell him she disagreed with his belief that former national security adviser John Bolton's allegations about President Donald Trump and Ukraine make it important for the Senate to hear from Bolton personally. Loeffler, then, needs to prove to conservatives that she can be just as Trump-y as Collins. “She’s a student. In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Kemp was elected in a bitter and extremely tightly contested 2018 race that many Democrats alleged was plagued by voting irregularities (Kemp was serving as secretary of state and the chief election officer for the state while simultaneously running for governor). If no candidate gets 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters would advance to a January 2021 runoff.). Which, well, ouch. “I make no apologies for my conservative values, and will proudly support President Trump’s conservative judges.”, Supporters say she has taken pains to reach out to grass-roots groups. December 4, 2019 / 11:08 AM / CBS News Businesswoman Kelly Loeffler played up her conservative credentials and opposition to impeachment as … But the danger posed by Mr. Collins, who has become one of the president’s most strident and public-facing defenders among House Republicans, looms large. “She’s not only got to become a full-fledged voting senator here with an office here and an office in the state, she’s got to put a campaign together.”. Hence Loeffler, not Collins. Cloistered in the Senate chamber for hours a day and commanded to stay silent, she is unable to familiarize herself with the labyrinthine layout of the Capitol or schedule one-on-one meetings to get to know her colleagues or discuss legislation.

Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, who is all of a month into her job, lashed out at one of her fellow Republicans, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, for pressing to subpoena Mr. Bolton, accusing her colleague of wanting to “appease the left by calling witnesses who will slander the @realDonaldTrump during their 15 minutes of fame.”, “The circus is over,” she added in a post on the president’s favorite platform, Twitter. Isakson, 74, announced in August he would retire from the Senate due to health issues. And Collins is a hero among that group. She looks at these issues very carefully.”. During a speech from the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, Loeffler described herself as a senator who, like President Trump, is an "outsider" and one who would back Mr. Trump's agenda. “Politics is loud and the pressure is on,” said Ryan Mahoney, a senior strategist close to both Mr. Kemp and Ms. Loeffler. Brian Kemp of Georgia, that was precisely the point of selecting her to serve out the term of Mr. Isakson, who retired in December because of an illness. He delivered a goodbye speech from the Senate floor Tuesday.

Pro-military. Because she is a largely, still an unknown commodity among the base Republicans she needs to win. Be in the know. Taking their cue from Mr. Trump, some of his allies attacked Ms. Loeffler’s credentials as insufficiently conservative and fumed when Mr. Kemp appointed her.
