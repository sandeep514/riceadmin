There are no secrets anymore.                                              It’s a given when the stakes are high and the competition is working ferociously to beat you. The person who understands the most can see around corners. It's my job to take motivated people and show them how to become better.”, “It's a very competitive thing, pro sports. To losers, desperation and despondency are just as harmful.”, “Afford each person the same respect, support, and fair treatment you would expect if your roles were reversed. Work. That way when you get to the criticism, at least you know he'll be listening.”, “We have no leadership. The opportunity to play.” - Mike Singletary, “Talent determines what you can do. ", "Something goes wrong, I yell at them -"Fix it"- whether it's their fault or not. But I think the fundamentals of the process will remain the same.”, “I am who I am. So is life.” - Joe Namath, “Don't be a spectator. Sometimes, getting up in the morning and brushing your teeth is the hardest part of the day - it all just hurts.”, “I have a memory, and I can just eliminate mistakes when they come up because I've already made them.”, “We all have experiences in our lives that change us, and we all learn from people, like my dad, but at the end of the day, it's only us. 1. ", “At least 80 percent of the success of the football team is determined by the fight and spirit that they put into their play.”, “You might reduce Lombardi's coaching philosophy to a single sentence: In any game, you do the things you do best and you do them over and over and over.”, “What makes a good coach? -Gran”, “I don’t know any other couple who has been to hell and back more than the two of us. These people just don’t know when to quit; that’s why they’re winners and have the ability to move us to work harder. Everyone likes to play, but no one likes to practice.” - Bum Phillips, “One of the best things others can say about you is you’re a hard worker. Welcome back. Knowing it will happen and what you must do when it does is the first step back.”, “Calculated risks are part of what you do, but the idea that something completely crazy will work just because it's completely crazy is completely crazy.”, “We have a lot of players in their first year. Nothing builds a team like adversity.”, “I'll tolerate you until I can replace you.”, “People aren't very good listeners, by nature. The family you created. ", "The problem with most leaders today is they don't stand for anything. You care about who is standing beside you when the shit hits the fan.”, “Love is life. “Even when you’re stubborn… And Bossy”, “But even work stops at some point. If you develop tunnel-vision on each and every hiccup, you will inevitably lose sight of the big picture and not be able to sustain your business. It’s the will to prepare to win that matters.”, “Never quit. She stayed true to herself and never compromised her integrity. Because nothing else matters if you’re not with me.” ― J. - Sean McVay, "What I am going to put my time into is how we can coach them better and how we can play better." Determine your players talents and give them every weapon to get the most from those talents.”, “Success is the peace of mind that comes when you know you have given everything you have to give to the opportunities that life has presented you.”, “Lots of leaders want to be popular. And he'll never out-work me. It's not the play - it's when you run it. Be a game changer the world has enough followers. We play with whatever or kick with whatever we have to use and that’s the way it is.”, “I could tell you that in my entire coaching career I have never talked to any player, staff member about football air pressure. Because when everything else is a distant memory, the people you love are all that’s left. I cause me stress because I can’t relax when it comes to you. I try to capture a concept, an idea or a moment in a few words. ", "The thing we found out was, when you get to a Super Bowl, both teams are treated the same, talked about in glowing terms. If you don’t play better than the other players then somebody takes your place. To have the results very few people have, the have the results of game-changers you need to start thinking and behaving like a game-changer. It's great to share success.” - Jim Harbaugh, “If you don't believe it yourself your team darn sure won’t.” - Rex Ryan, “I feel I am a players' coach. You must believe it though.”, “In a world full of game players, the only way to set yourself apart is to be a game changer.”, “Words are useless without action. If you can walk you can run. - Mike Vrabel, "You can't play hard, you can't play here." We’ve had to learn to work together. If we achieve that, the results is that we'll win.”, "The harder you work, the harder it is to surrender. When you use the term 'letdown' you proceed with the assumption that this is a continuation of something that happened in the past.”, “Football doesn't build character, it reveals character.”, “Adversity is an opportunity for heroism.”, “What you do should speak so loudly that no one will hear what you say.”, “Our goal is to develop our team, to earn what we get, to learn, to develop unselfish attitudes. All you’ve got to do is catch it." You’re my game changer. I do, and I demand that my players do.”, “Some of us will do our jobs well and some will not, but we will be judged by only one thing-the result.”, “The measure of who we are is what we do with what we have.”, “People who work together will win, whether it be against complex football defenses, or the problems of modern society.”, “Leadership is based on a spiritual quality; the power to inspire, the power to inspire others to follow.”, “The spirit, the will to win, and the will to excel are the things that endure. : “The one man team is a complete and total myth.”, “I'm just a guy who rolls up his sleeves and goes to work!”, “My coaching philosophy? ", "I like linebackers. Never look back and never look ahead.”, “Everyone’s job is important, but no one is indispensable.”, “I’ve always avoided publicity. You just have to have one. You have to get up the next morning.”, “Football is one-third offense, one-third defense, and one-third special teams.”, “We should favor innovation and freedom over regulation.”, ​“I’m no miracle man. You discourage your enemies.”, “All you have to think about is that guy across from me is human, and so am I. That's a winner.”, “We are stronger together than we are alone.”, “Tough times go away, tough people do not.”, “I want to be remembered as the guy who gave his all whenever he was on the field.”, “I am happy to say that everyone that I have met in my life, I have gained something from them; be it negative or positive, it has enforced and reinforced my life in some aspect.”, “If you forget your roots, you've lost sight of everything.”, "Remember, tomorrow is promised to no one. And I never want to live without you. And if you refuse to work as hard as you possibly can toward that aim, or if you do anything that keeps you from achieving that goal, then you are just cheating yourself.”, "The superior man blames himself. - Sean McVay, "When you lose, everyone can do a little bit more. Receive it. Lucky for me, she found me right back.”, “Listen, that girl is my world, and I can’t stand the thought of anyone hurting her. But if you want to be committed, you're going to be committed. Watch your words, they become your actions. You’ve been knocked senseless; give yourself a little time to recuperate. Complete dedication.”, “The fewer rules a coach has, the fewer rules there are for players to break.”, “The only yardstick for success our society has is being a champion. It's getting ahead of yourself.” - Roger Staubach, “If you're not gonna go all the way, why go at all?” - Joe Namath, “Stay focused. It's truly that simple. It doesn't matter who you are: I'm going to respect you.” - Andy Reid, “The NFL is a unique workplace. - Russell Wilson, "When you go through a difficult space, what were the lessons learned? Set the trend and make the competition counter you.”, “Strong leaders don't plead with individuals to perform.”, “Many people erroneously think they have only one chance to succeed, and if they miss that chance, they are doomed to failure.
