If they'd signed a bad player who was a Catholic, I … ", A spokesman for the Catholic Church in Scotland said: "The brave words of Fernando Ricksen are a sad indictment of our society. An indication that the policy was specifically anti-Catholic rather than Protestant-only was Ran… At Rangers' Ibrox Stadium, the Union Flag  and Ulster banner  are often displayed, whilst at Celtic Park, the Irish tricolourprevails. [23][30] Johnston was fined by FIFA for breaking his agreement with Celtic, who could have prevented Johnston from playing by completing the deal. Long winning run required before we get too excited.

Unfortunately, a minority is letting that down.” A spokeswoman for Celtic said that, as well as being involved in several projects with other agencies, the club was pushing the Scottish Executive to help drive home the anti-sectarian message to schools. [16][17] Despite this assertion, no senior Catholic players were signed by Rangers following it;[16] promising youth player John Spencer did join the club in 1982 and quietly progressed through the ranks, while having to deal with hostility from both sides of the Glasgow religious divide as a result. [32] In the same year, Rangers lifted a ban on players making the sign of the cross at the behest of Gabriel Amato but warned them not to do it in front of supporters. In 2002 defender Fernando Ricksen said that Rangers' Catholic players had to hide their religion because of sectarianism at the club. [28] The Rangers kitman refused to lay out Johnston's kit before each match as a protest against a Catholic playing for Rangers.  I was just happy they punted him and he ended up back with us. Prior to the First World War, Rangers did not have any policy regarding players' religion, and at that time the club did have a number of Catholic players. There will be a lot of people handing in their season tickets. I really wanted to be the first person to say "Kenny Miller" and start the haters off. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

In an extraordinary outburst on the Old Firm’s continuing problems with bigoted fans, Ricksen said: "If you’re Catholic and you play for Rangers, then you are a Protestant. You stay away. We didn’t expect it and you can bet your house neither did they. [11] The former Rangers player and Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has written that although Rangers' management knew of his decision to marry a Catholic, he experienced "poisonous hostility" from the club's PR officer Willie Allison. Thereafter, Catholic players prior to Mo Johnston's signing include: Laurie Blyth (1951–1952), Don Kitchenbrand (1955–1956), Hugh O'Neill (1976), John Spencer (1985–1992) (Bill Murray, The Old Firm – Sectarianism, Sport and Society in Scotland (John Donald Publishers, 1984) pp 64–5. There were claims in the media that it was done to counter a FIFA inquiry into sectarianism. The great Rangers Catholic Player debate. Oh, I still said it anyway... as long as they do the busniess for the Rangers a dont care what religion they are.

System Three interviewed 900 people for the BBC Scotland survey. The taigs claimed that many on that list were made up. [8] Northern Irish club Linfield, which shares a similar culture to Rangers, had a similar policy, though not as strict as Rangers', until the 1980s, as a contrast to their Big Two rivals Glentoran. [12], By contrast, Celtic never had a similar policy banning players of any religion. [29] Some fans responded by burning their season tickets, although this view was not shared by all of the Rangers supporters. The Orange Order stated "Let us be perfectly blunt. [23] Some welcomed the fact that they had got one over their rivals,[23] while the Johnston signing brought back some lapsed fans who had been troubled by religious discrimination. [4][5] An indication that the policy was specifically anti-Catholic rather than Protestant-only was Rangers' signing of Egyptian international Mohamed Latif in 1934.
