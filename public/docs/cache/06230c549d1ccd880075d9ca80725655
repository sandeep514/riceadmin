And yes, there are pictures too if you feel you must have them. Frankly, even if this anecdote were plausible, let alone true, this doesn't support a nanny dog claim so much as it supports a sociopathic, baby abusing, dog abusing parent claim. bullshit.People are forgetting that this dog has been bred specifically for killing. It is propaganda. The smarter the dog, the easier it is to train him, as long as you go about the training in the right way. I'll say this. </p> <p>I know what I stand for and I stand for forgivness, you should do the same because knowing a 18yr old brought up in a world full of hate still believing in hope should help you understand that just because bad things happen and it's a specific group of things doesn't mean everything in that group is bad. RETARDS. </p> <p>We need to reference this as often as possible people!! </p> <p>Get out and spend some time with one instead of reading about them on the 'net. Title: But I wont hold my breath in fear of dying. every person, and im not exaggerating at all, every person who meets either of my dogs is amazed at how well they are behaved. You want to breed for a better pit bull? If you want to prove that point, it is up to you to do the work and gather the proof.If you want to prove that the problem is not pit bulls but guarding and breeding dogs, you will have to show evidence that all breeds of dogs used as guard dogs or are breeding kill as much as guard pit bulls and breeding pit bulls. </p> <p>Today we take a look back at the infamous Mr. Nanny “dog tossing” scene. With that being said, I am a serious dog lover, of all breeds and I worry that with BSL we are not getting to the heart of the issue and solving the real problem- irresponsible breeding and irresponsible ownership. A handful of photos. </p> <p>@ Cory"The term "nanny dog" should not be taken to a literal extreme. We need to get this out for everybody to see so they too can know the truth.And thank you for sharing that information, April 29. </p> <p>I'm from the UK and had a Staffi for 12 and a half years. How many of the above posters has, or have had an English Staffodshire Bull Terrier.Thank you all. </p> <p>You can't live in a bubble and like it or not pit bulls save lives every year too. while you are educating all of those american pit nutters, you might want to educate the following obnoxious kennel clubs:the UKChttp://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/Breeds/StaffordshireBullTerrierthe CKChttp://www.continentalkennelclub.com/Ads.aspx?BreedNum=654NKChttp://www.nationalkennelclub.com/Breed-Standards/Staffordshire%20Bull%20Terrier.htmthe NZKChttp://www.nzkc.org.nz/br280.htmlthe AKChttp://www.akc.org/breeds/staffordshire_bull_terrier/index.cfmthe kennel club of the united kingdomhttp://www.the-kennel-club.org.uk/services/public/breeds/display.aspx?id=3080, seriously you are speaking out of ignorance. Check out our picks for family friendly movies movies that transcend all ages. "You mentioned that "it's perfectly plausible that a dog could be a pit fighter and still safe for children to be around" so no, I did not twist your words around. </p> <p>- no personal document with those images. You can't lie about that anymore because if you doubt any assertions made here, you can verify it yourself. Two boys learn from a mysterious warrior that they are the heirs to the throne of Patusan and set out to overthrow the current monarchy. Have you been reading the post on this blog at all? </p> <p>However, Australia, England, and New Zealand make clear a distinction between the American Pit Bull Terrier and Staffordshire Bull Terrier and thus are exempted from Breed Specific Legislation. They are terriers and not a mention of 'pit' in the name. The Stafford we know today quickly becomes a member of the family circle. They were not. You do not know the history of the individual dog and you do not know if it was a well loved family dog. :)http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Toddler-Joshua-Mann-From-Brockworth-Mauled-By-Familys-Collie-Dog-Gets-200-Stitches/Article/201009215724722?lpos=UK_News_Top_Stories_Header_0&lid=ARTICLE_15724722_Toddler_Joshua_Mann_From_Brockworth_Mauled_By_Familys_Collie_Dog_Gets_200_Stitches_Ban these too? If pit bulls are held in low esteem today, it is only due to ignorance and the gullible acceptance of biased news reporting because, once upon a time, pit bulls were the most beloved dog in England and the United States. Just because you haven’t found it on the internet doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. much like only cancer patients can research cancer or the oil industry can research global warming.as for the first comment, maybe you didn't read closely enough, the author does acknowledge the nanny dog myth is rooted in the english version of the pit bull. Dog breeds exist so they can be discriminated against from their form to their function; that's their whole purpose. </p> <p>Yet every time a pittie bites someone it's all over the headlines but when another breed bites it doesn't even make the papers. </p> <p>This ain't no nanny dog. YOUR RESEARCH IS BASED SOLELY ON THE NANNY DOG MYTH!! </p> <p>Later, wack-a-doodle. Apparently all you need as proof by your criteria is a bunch of pictures of a certain breed with the child. Why so much about general research about the "pit bull" when the nanny dog is specifically the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier.2. </p> <p>now modern science tells us that when inbreeding occurs, recessed genes and metal disorders begin to emerge more prevalent. Daniels brings up Dickens' villainous Bull's-Eye again and Mrs. Rant acknowledges that the Stafford ", had an unsavory reputation for fighting and violence and his name became associated with ruffians, who cared little for him as a dog but only for his ability in the pit. Education is the key when you own a bully breed.I watch the news just as much as the next gal, so i see the storys about pit bull attacks to... but i've also seen storys about APBT saving lifes and being used in police work,search & rescue and as therapy dogs along with many other jobs.I take my dog next month to start her CGC classes then i want to start taking her to schools. Like blacks are people, APBT are dogs. </p> <p>Name any other breed of dog who's come close to the mauling and fatal attacks of the pit bull since their inception and in recent history. One point already well known, the other an opinion. </p> <p>@ ToroNo, Staffordshire terriers are part of the pit bull type, and they were a foundation breed for the APBT, so genetically they are related despite being two different breeds. Well, there are a lot of Saint Bernards with kids, were they nanny dogs? </p> <p>thanks for the misinformation! It is also absolutely true that the vast majority of pits I see are less than a year old. </p> <p>Oh and if you havent noticed there is more pitbulls/pitbull mix breeds out there then any other breed right now, of course you see more incidents about them in the news. The dog fighters were, however, as persevering a set of men as were the bull baiters, and they set to work to remodel their favorites for their new occupation. Was this review helpful to you? </p> <p>Lissy Meister leidt, met haar drie kinderen en een veeleisende baan, een druk leven. The more we click on this blog, the higher up in the ranks it will go, and this needs to be number one when a search on nanny dogs is done. I have no idea what a pit bull"ranch dog" might be and one idiot trying to get pit bulls to do some sort of "ranch work" in 1904 that came to nothing actually proves Digger's point that pit bulls weren't successfully used for anything but dog fighting (attacking and killing pit bulls or die trying), hog dogging (attacking and killing hogs or die trying), big game "hunting" (attacking and killing bears and cougars or die trying). Moreover, he has the terrier's way of fighting. I suppose not or they didn't learn to be a bit skeptical.Propaganda, advertising, pit nutter "facts", all are the same thing. Thank you, BAD RAP, It's Dog Bite Prevention Week. Posted by 3 years ago. During a championship baseball match, the three brothers hear that their grandfather in Japan is in trouble, and head out to help him, conceding the match. Early on they were used as farm helpers, service dogs, police dogs, etc. i hear that the state actually forbids human beings from discriminating against canines! While clearly there is a large group of people who are against American Pit Bull Terriers (obvious statement, proven solely by insurance companies and BSL), but with all the outrage against the dog, why is there no outrage towards their owners and breeders? More pictures! </p> <p>5 second photos that don't show the entire lifetime interaction of the dog and child. Thanks for clearing that up. Yes, any breed can be dangerous but not every breed can be dangerous to the level of a pit bull. thanks.dogsbite.org is covering this bizarre "accident". Your argument is faulty and flawed, now you're just scraping at the bottom of the barrel in hopes that some form of copy-pasted information you throw out in your defense will actually work. First you use photos as "proof" of your assertion which literally means nothing. I've seen the damage an APBT can do.. but I've also felt the love they can give.I'm an APBT owner and always will be. </p> <p>The news accounts said the grandfather loved the dog. I'm tired of hearing this "it's not the dog it's the owner my pitbull is a sweetie!" </p> <p>I've never seen a dog get upset when I mention that "x breed is better for x or worse for x." Jack the brindle bulldog was most likely an american bulldog but he could have been an APBT. Despite the fact that I know they exist and despite the fact that providing these reports would immediately remove any criticisms on the nanny dog." Further, I have seen every one of those animals make aggressive moves towards any human that is doing something they do not understand. it is never JUST the breed, it is never JUST the owner. People will not begin abandoning their beloved dogs and running from the pit bulls. it is always a combination. !It will be great when people do a search on pitbull nanny dogs and this one is first so they can learn the truth. </p> <p></p> <p>be sure to come back. So, the lie becomes that Staffordshire Bull Terriers were ALWAYS known as nanny dogs. The reason people do not worry about those breeds are due to several reasons. You're admitting that having a pit bull type dog is a game of Russian roulette so why even mention this as though this somehow validates the pit bulls ability to be a nanny dog?As for their ability to work. I personally know two Staffies in my neighborhood. </p> <p>Everyone who sees her says she's a pit. @ snack sized dogExactly the very points that need to be mentioned. please don't exaggerate that societal change. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:12:"mr nanny dog";s:5:"links";s:5486:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/troy-brown-coach-86e6ec'>Troy Brown Coach</a>,
