Pale Fire This slim book houses a stupendous number of participants (more than three hundred) but the ochlophobic sensation peculiar to other overcrowded books (such as Ulysses) is completely offset by means of regular and carefully dosed injections of ephemeral yet  much alive personae who usually enter and exit the novel within one syntactic period and who have little or no bearing on the plot.7  Time management is likewise marked by several interesting features; one will notice, for instance, the extreme compression of time as the novels unwinds  (the first three chapters  span almost two-and-a-half years, the next four less than a year), ingenious flashbacks and timeslides in every chapter, and chronological duplexity created by a deliberate confusion of calendar styles, nowhere to a stronger effect than in Chapter Three, where "Pnin's Day" (his birthday, February 15, ignored by Pnin because of the academic routine and calendar mix-up) may be in fact the day of Pushkin's death (February 10), so that Pnin's premonition of death, mingled with Pushkin's melancholy verse, colors and even shapes the chapter as its dominant theme.8.
