I definitely prefer a touch of ambiguity in horror, just enough to leave me with that lingering sense of dread, and it is unfortunate that Matheson doesn’t really do that here. He was fifteen-years-old when he took part in an investigation of Hell House. “Every room we enter is immediately haunted,” exclaims Charlotte, a librarian and occult enthusiast, in the opening line. Barrett will not be going to the Hell House alone. Okay, so here goes my first ever book review! Anything was considered acceptable in Belasco’s house. People came and visited and never went home. He is skeptical of Dr. Barrett’s hypotheses but openly recognizes the dangerous nature of Florence’s openness towards whatever it is that inhabit’s Hell House. Because of his health problems Barrett and his wife do not enjoy a physical relationship and so that also presents an area of weakness for the house to work on. His reliance on logic, reason, and the scientific method is as fervorous and nigh fanatical as Florence’s belief on the lingering presence of spirits and the power God. All Rights Reserved. Who — or what — is the source of the haunting is the central question posed by Dennis Mahoney. Yearning for a connection, William resolves to help her solve the mystery of her death as well as find a way to release her from the liminal state in which she’s confined. I was in my youth, able to stay up late and break night like nobody's business. Credit... Patrick Guedj/Gamma-Rapho, via Getty Images. If you want to contrast how male and female authors write the same story, you could hardly find a more perfect example than Richard Matheson's Hell House , as compared to Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House . March 8, 2019 Comments : 12. ( Log Out /  Patrick Guedj/Gamma-Rapho, via Getty Images. But he is conflicted since he doesn’t want to lose her. The building itself evolves and reshapes, reacting to William’s moods and preternatural state of grief, loneliness and longing. Dr. Barrett has very strong, deeply rooted beliefs in the science. I have always enjoyed a good haunted house story and Hell House is exactly that—a good haunted house story. One night she doesn’t return home to her husband and 7-year-old son, William. Barrett’s guess is correct; the dying man is looking for proof of survival after death. We'll assume you're ok with this, but you can opt-out if you wish. He discovers that a mystical book called “The Book of Elements,” one his mother spent her final days searching for with Leonard Stick, may provide a way for June to be released from her earthly bounds. Hell House takes place during Christmas week 1970, and the book was published in 1971. Hell House is the sexually awkward tale of a haunted house that can't even bother to be haunted until the book is nearly over. Matheson strikes a masterful balance between the looming horror of the house itself and the complicated psyches of the four protagonists. Accompanying Dr. Barrett on this journey are his assistant and wife (Dr. Barrett had polio which has left him with a bum leg) Edith, a spiritual medium Florence Tanner, and the sole survivor of the previous excursion to Hell House (also a medium) Benjamin Franklin Fischer. Three weeks later she wakes William, asks him to hold her hand, and dies. I’m a tremendous fan of horror movies and a passionate bookworm, sharing book and scary movie reviews every week.

Barrett is not happy about having Tanner and Fischer forced upon him, but he has little choice in the matter and the group of three quickly becomes four when Barrett’s wife Edith also insists on tagging along. It is host to a number of quirky characters and mysteries, both otherworldly and not: a three-winged pigeon that stubbornly visits the same windowsill; a recalcitrant but unseen basement resident; a large queen centipede with a personality akin to a loyal family dog; and the ghost of a young woman named June. While there are aspects of some of the technology used in the novel that might not jive with our more modern sensibilities this is really a minor issue and the strength of the prose easily overcomes any such difficulties. Hell House centers around four strangers who are tasked with investigating the infamous Belasco House in order to discover whether or not life after death exists. The couple’s playfulness, selfishness and codependency are authentic and claustrophobic. The build up of fear and tension was so great during the novels middle section that the final chapters felt a bit weaker by the resolution of that fear. I only even discovered it because I played 'The Wolf Among Us' made by Telltale, and liked it so much I tracked down the entire series at my local library to read it. Edith does not handle separation from her husband well. ( Log Out /  Charlotte returns home but suffers from dementia-like episodes. In the middle of this conflict between science and spirituality is Benjamin whose past experience’s with the house have left him shaken. Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend. Matheson generates a dark atmosphere in the house from the very beginning of the story and he keeps it up until the end. Just thinking out loud. It takes the basic premise of The Haunting of Hill House – that there’s a scientist and his wife, and two people who have had prior experience with the paranormal; and that together they will spend a week in a very famous haunted house for the purpose … Deutsch is a dying man and the parapsychologist has never met him before and so has no idea why the millionaire has requested to see him; although he guesses that it will have something to do with parapsychology. He plans to send Barrett to The Belasco House in Maine-a place that has seen to much paranormal activity that it is more commonly referred to as Hell House.                                     RELEASE DATE: June 28, 1971. When he was just a child Ben Fischer was one of the most powerful mediums in the world. Nothing was considered too sick or depraved. The story is set in the December of 1970 and begins on the eighteenth, at 3:17 in the afternoon. Strange things are seen heard and felt by all of the characters and each one of them has their own opinion about what is really going on, although each of them would probably admit that their theories only scratch the surface of what is a much deeper puzzle. With its openly bleeding heart and philosopher’s spirit, the odd and undeniably affecting “Ghostlove” explores ways in which we haunt ourselves. The real juiciest bits of Hell House, and where Matheson’s talent truly shines, is in the portrayal of the competing beliefs between the various individuals on the expedition. Richard Matheson’s Hell House may be the best haunted house story of all time. Most of you probably don’t know this, but I love to read and always have from a young age.

The premise of the novel is fairly straightforward: a rich dying business man offers a noted scientist, Dr. Barrett, an obscene sum of money… The history of the house is presented expertly, sinking its teeth into the reader with the depraved and twisted truth, and making it difficult to put the book down. If the existence of a ghost is proof of an afterlife, then one can argue ghost stories are ultimately optimistic. Florence’s church is only a converted store though. The book is about 300 pages long and is not divided up into traditional chapters but is, instead, separated by dates and times, with the date being the equivalent of a chapter and the time forming a kind of sub-chapter. I also write about my everyday life–the good and the bad. in which our hero pretends he knows what he is talking about. This website uses cookies to improve your experience.

In short, the book tells the story of Keith Linder and his girlfriend Tina who moved in to a house in Bothell, a suburb of Seattle, Washington in 2012 and experienced a prolonged bout of poltergeist type phenomena. It has the bones of Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House though, while Jackson’s novel is psychological and leaves the reader with many questions by the end, Hell House is full of physical terror that is happy to give you all the answers by the very last page.
