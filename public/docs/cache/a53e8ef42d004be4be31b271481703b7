If I do not get the oil of Maikop and Grozny then I must finish [liquidieren; "kill off", "liquidate"] this war. Bergström quotes: Soviet Reports on the effects of air raids between 23–26 August 1942. Field Marshal Erich von Manstein advised Hitler not to order the 6th Army to break out, stating that he could break through the Soviet lines and relieve the besieged 6th Army. After over six months of fighting at Stalingrad, the German Sixth Army was encircled and captured. 1, suffered particularly heavy losses. Unable to break out, the Germans also had to face the winter. Some 1,000 tons of bombs were dropped in 48 hours, more than in London at the height of the Blitz. Stalin’s order was “Not a step backwards”. In spite of the failure of the German offensive to reach the 6th Army, the air supply operation continued under ever more difficult circumstances. Stalingrad was also an important target as it was Russia’s centre of communications in the south as well as being a centre for manufacturing.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'historylearningsite_co_uk-medrectangle-4','ezslot_9',114,'0','0'])); In early September 1942, the German Army advanced to the city. The battle started with the South Western Front. Germany was looking in the face of defeat. Having slowly advanced over 10 days against strong Soviet resistance, the 51st Army Corps was finally in front of the three giant factories of Stalingrad: the Red October Steel Factory, the Barrikady Arms Factory and Stalingrad Tractor Factory. Paulus attempted to take over the industrial areas in the north of Stalingrad but this attack failed severely. With the situation desperate, Paulus asked Hitler for permission to surrender but was refused. [31]:98 The third and last serviceable runway was at the Stalingradskaya flight school, which reportedly had the last landings and takeoffs on 23 January. It was later renamed Stalingrad Front, then had the Don Front split off from it. Responding with another counter-offensive on December 16 (Operation Little Saturn), the Soviets began driving the Germans back on a wide front effectively ending German hopes for relieving Stalingrad. Inside the pocket (German: Kessel, literally "cauldron"), there were also around 10,000 Soviet civilians and several thousand Soviet soldiers the Germans had taken captive during the battle. Hitler’s aim was to split the Allies in their drive toward Germany. Of those captured, fewer than 6,000 survived to return to Germany. At the beginning of February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad, having exhausted their ammunition and food, surrendered[24]:932 after five months, one week and three days of fighting. After only a couple hours, the German army was left in a devastating state. "He described the situation in very sombre terms", recorded Raus. Amid the debris of the wrecked city, the Soviet 62nd and 64th Armies, which included the Soviet 13th Guards Rifle Division, anchored their defence lines with strong-points in houses and factories. [81], The Royal Romanian Air Force was also involved in the Axis air operations at Stalingrad. In the region of location of the 38th Motorised Rifle Brigade in a basement eighteen armed SS-men (sic) were found, who refused to surrender, the Germans found were destroyed.[125]. In September 1942, the German commander of the Sixth Army, General Paulus, assisted by the Fourth Panzer Army, advanced on the city of Stalingrad. The implication was clear: if Paulus surrendered, he would shame himself and would become the highest ranking German officer ever to be captured. Morale was raised in the Allies side and the morale of the Nazi Germans was lowered. [1]:122 The exact number of civilians killed is unknown but was most likely very high. Axis losses are estimated at 650,000-750,000 killed and wounded as well as 91,000 captured. Stalingrad was also an important target as it was Russia’s centre of communications in the south as well as being a centre for manufacturing. The 369th (Croatian) Reinforced Infantry Regiment was the only non-German unit[45] selected by the Wehrmacht to enter Stalingrad city during assault operations. The city's factories continued to operate, including one producing T-34 tanks. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'historylearningsite_co_uk-leader-1','ezslot_11',115,'0','0'])); Hitler ordered that Paulus should fight to the last bullet, and to encourage Paulus, he promoted him to field marshal. In the middle of World War II – having captured territory in much of present-day Ukraine and Belarus in the spring on 1942 – Germany’s Wehrmacht forces decided to mount an offensive on southern Russia in the summer of that year.Under the leadership of ruthless head of state Joseph Stalin, Russian forces had already successfully rebuffed a German attack on the western part of the country – one that had the ultimate goal of taking Mos… This second plan was given the name Operation Thunderclap. Both sides were trying to take control of the city of Stalingrad (now named Volgograd). Neither Army Group North nor Army Group South had been particularly hard pressed over the winter. "Исторические документы. The speech contained an oblique reference to the battle, which suggested that Germany was now in a defensive war. [Note 7], As historian Chris Bellamy notes, the Germans paid a high strategic price for the aircraft sent into Stalingrad: the Luftwaffe was forced to divert much of its air strength away from the oil-rich Caucasus, which had been Hitler's original grand-strategic objective. After a few weeks on such a diet, he had "visibly lost weight", according to Albert Speer, and Hitler "commanded Zeitzler to resume at once taking sufficient nourishment. The German offensive started well. [50][51][52][53] The Germans pushing forward into Stalingrad suffered heavy casualties. 				Change ), You are commenting using your Twitter account. [74], The German onslaught crushed the 37th Guards Rifle Division of Major General Viktor Zholudev and in the afternoon the forward assault group reached the tractor factory before arriving at the Volga River, splitting the 62nd Army into two. – GCSE History – Marked by Teachers.com, http://www.markedbyteachers.com/gcse/history/why-did-hitler-order-an-attack-on-stalingrad-yet- fail-to-capture-it.html [Accessed 18 Oct. 2017]. This force grew to 1,600 in early September by withdrawing forces from the. At four in the morning on 2 February, Strecker was informed that one of his own officers had gone to the Soviets to negotiate surrender terms. Marked by fierce close-quarters combat  and direct assaults on civilians in air raids, it is one of the bloodiest  battles in the history of warfare, with an estimated 2 million total casualties. England would be again bombarded, threat of invasion revived... And now! As no German field marshal had ever been captured, he expected him to fight to the end or commit suicide. "We haven't had time to deal with them yet," one of the Russians said. Soviet offensives in the central and northern portions of the Eastern Front tied down Luftwaffe reserves and newly built aircraft, reducing Luftflotte 4's percentage of Eastern Front aircraft from 60 percent on 28 June to 38 percent by 20 September.
