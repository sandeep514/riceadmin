Winter 2015: A Time of Celebration and Diversity, Homecoming 2015: A Time of Opportunity and Growth.  “Who would want to date a one-eyed basketball player?”, Kendra’s laugh soon turned into a look of sincerity.  Victor Oladipo of the Orlando Magic talks recovering from injury, the youth of the team, how he improves his game while on the bench while injured, advice from his twin sister … And then there’s her younger brother Victor, who—with all the publicity he’s getting these days—has no problem knowing that somewhere he’s just “Kendra’s brother.”, “Kendra is my big sister and I love her,” Victor said in an exclusive interview with The Buff and Blue. “It was very difficult for my family to accept,” Kendra explained. Language; Watch; Edit (Redirected from Oladipo, Victor) Kehinde Babatunde Victor Adrian Oladipo (born May 4, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association.    “I just felt [Indiana] was my home,” he said. Kendra, 22, is a senior at Gallaudet, where she double-majors in communication studies and theatre. A scout said that at best, with extra work in the gym, Victor could only be an “above-average” player in the Big 10. Here's Why, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini: Comparing Apple’s New 5G Phones, News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. Victor urged her to reconsider. I abhor vivisection with my whole soul. “No drugs, no drinking,” Kendra counted with her fingers. And finally, embedded within Victor is a commodity so rare nowadays in professional sports that it’s become somewhat of a myth: Humility. After the No. But what Kendra had yet to realize is how much of an influence she has on her brother.  “That,” Kendra signed, pointing at the basketball player in the photos, “is my baby brother.”. She explained that when with her family, she resorts to speaking and lip-reading, all while wearing a look of disdain. "I don't understand," she wrote, "how you let Trevor Mbakwe score 21 points and get 12 rebounds.  I thoroughly enjoyed the read. I enjoyed reading about the two beautiful people here and look forward to learning about their successes in the future. “That’s nice and all, but at the end of the day, he’ll always be my little brother, and that’s the only thing that matters.”. “Not a lot of what people could have gone through what she did and still have a smile on their faces,” Victor said, adding that he has nothing but admiration for his sister. Staff; 03/12/2013 12:51 pm in Quicklink ; The Wall Street Journal: What Victor Owes Victoria. She found out about Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., the world’s only institution of higher education that provides programs and services for deaf and hard of hearing students. First came Kristine, then Kendra, and twenty months later the twins Victor and Victoria. There have been can’t-miss prep stars driving Hummers and signing lucrative endorsement deals before logging a single second at the professional level. She learned ASL. 110 on Chad Ford’s NBA draft board on ESPN.com. Kehinde Babatunde Victor Oladipo (born May 4, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association. True, but exactly how true? “My relationship with [Kendra] has grown strong, especially over the past few years,” Victor affirmed. “Gallaudet was the best place for me to continue my journey,” Kendra concluded.  Kendra, at age 18: She’ll never really fit in.  Required fields are marked *. Gallaudet may be the only place in the country where Kendra is the better-known Oladipo. After Victor was recruited by a number of high-profile schools, including hometown favorite University of Maryland, there was some pressure from the family-oriented Oladipos for Victor to stay close to home. Another might be National Champion, and in June, perhaps NBA lottery pick. Your email address will not be published. 6 and rising, and there’s a growing sentiment that he’s a candidate for the No. Chris and his wife, Joan, natives of Nigeria, raised Victor and daughters Kristine, Kendra and Victoria (Victor’s twin) together in suburban Washington, D.C.  The RA at LLRH6?” my friend gaped. “I remember thinking to myself, ‘One day he was this 5’5” munchkin, and the next he’s a foot taller,” Kendra chuckled, referring to her 6’5” brother. So Kendra went to Victor and explained that despite her theatre aspirations, she would start looking at other majors. So began the next chapter in their lives. He’s arguably the Hoosiers’ MVP this season and not to mention a front-runner for the Naismith (National Player of the Year) Trophy. He eventually signed with Indiana University. Victor, 20, is a junior guard for the nationally ranked (No.3), Big Ten Champion Indiana University men’s basketball team, which many consider to be the most complete team in the country and the odds-on-favorite to capture this year’s NCAA title. While this has led to Kendra’s newfound dreams of exposing young deaf children to a world of dance and theatre, Victor has dreams of his own. “I’d say to him, ‘Boy, how did you get up there?’”. “She’s one of the strongest people I know.”. He has never been to one of Victor’s college games. Last November, Victor was ranked No. Facebook |   Kendra, who communicates with Victor frequently via text messaging, said she especially enjoys the light-hearted moments they share, and she relived such an instance from earlier this year. “I don’t understand,” she wrote, “how you let Trevor Mbakwe score 21 points and get 12 rebounds.”, Her response to his response: “Never let that happen again.”, The Wall Street Journal on Victor Oladipo and his twin sister, 2020-21 ITH Season Preview: Ohio State Buckeyes, Brunk, Durham, Phinisee and Thompson voted captains for 2020-2021 season, POTB 342: Recapping IU media day with Dylan Wallace and Tyler Tachman, Burke, not Oladipo, named Big Ten Player of the Year. He was competing on the AAU circuit, looking to make a name for himself before a freak accident left him with a broken ankle, sidelining him for the rest of the summer. That’s her brother,” I explained. When asked about his outstanding work ethic, which is arguably his most talked about attribute, Victor pointed to his big sister. Chris and Joan Oladipo immigrated to the United States from Nigeria in the early 1980s to begin anew and provide a life of opportunities for the family they intended to start.  She briefly paused, then began, “I guess that’s why those moments are my favorite. “They [her family] all have said they want to learn [ASL]—my mom would trade the world to learn my language—but Victor’s the only one who’s done it.”. And as a result, Kendra and Victor are closer than ever.  I also have a granddaughter who was born with hearing issues. “So, to them, theatre isn’t exactly an ideal career path.”. He’s a projected lottery pick in this June’s NBA draft and has the basketball world raving, with ESPN’s Dick Vitale going so far as to compare him to—no, this isn’t a typo—Michael Jordan. “She has helped me understand that if I believe and have God on my side, there is nothing I can’t do or accomplish.”. Right now he’s at No. “Soon, it’ll be his turn to come out on top and experience that happiness.”. Photo Credit: Gallaudet Dance Company (left) and the Associated Press (right). I remember how happy she was,” Victor said. I’ll preach, and he’ll [Victor] just smile and nod.”. “‘Stick to the script,’ I told him,” Kendra recalled. “You know Kendra? Kendra recalled the summer after Victor’s freshman year in high school. “Mom always talks about the consequences of playing pro sports, about how at that level there are no rules,” Kendra said. Not that he needed reminding—I don’t know anyone who works harder than Victor—but I kept telling him to keep his eyes on the prize.”. Thoroughly enjoyed learning about Victor and Kendra. Consider this: Kendra, at age 8 (after losing her hearing): She’ll never be able to communicate. And so begins the story of two siblings divided by language and culture but forever connected by the way their lives have been shaped by each other. But when Kendra was eight years old, the lives of the Oladipos took an unexpected turn.
