In a scene in which two experienced plain clothes policemen ‘question’ Said and Hubert in an interrogation cell while a younger trainee officer looks on, a static camera is used, refusing us any respite from viewing the racial abuse and beating that is taking place. After working on the sets of several films and TV productions she discovered an interest in screenwriting and started writing her own stories. One of the more striking aspects of the “hood” or banlieue film, La Haine (literally, “the hate”), is the choice of protagonists. Vinz is the angriest character of the trio. He is guided by an underpinning realisation of the inescapable presence of the past within the present and an awareness of any society’s inability to deal with its current manifestation of itself without both knowledge and acknowledgment of its past. They share a common interest in American hip hop culture, Martin Scorsese movies and sports icons such as Muhammad Ali but what binds them together is their shared frustration with a world that seems to have no regard for them. (That Hubert is more politically aware is signalled, for instance, by the pictures on his bedroom wall.) Kassovitz’s intellectual starting point is the insight Barthes gives us as he famously sits down at the barber’s shop and picks up a copy of Paris Match with an image on the front cover of a young black boy in uniform, looking up and saluting the French flag. Could living museums keep indigenous culture alive? Some colonies, like Martinique, remain and are able to send representatives to the French Assembly. A single static shot of them sitting equidistant from each other in a bleak, empty space is held for some time and then an edit ‘jumps’ us forward to a shot of the same three characters in the same space but occupying slightly different positions within the frame. The story centres on the aftermath of a violent riot, triggered by the hospitalization of a young man called Abdel by the hands of the police. They don’t have the luxury of ‘maybe’s’ or ‘I suppose.’ Said, on the other hand, seems to be searching for his place in the ghetto, and gives no indications of wanting to get out. La Haine is filled with sarcastic irony and hidden meanings. Following the most recent terrorist attacks in Paris Kassovitz went on an uninhibited twitter rampage calling for Muslims to come out and personally condemn the attacks. Why Malawi needs a stronger feminist movement, Caribbean women: our health is our freedom, Caribbean community supports 1.5 degree climate target. La Haine, then, remains an important object in French media and culture, which is why it is both interesting and important to investigate today. Each of these scenes is brutal, but lack the Michael Bay flair of loud explosions and death defying stunts. It operates independently with the writers collaboratively building and maintaining the platform. The movie’s called HATE for a reason. Die Einfache Suche ist eine Freitext-Suche, bei der über ein einzelnes Suchfeld automatisch verschiedene Felder aller auf dem Deutschen Bildungsserver verfügbaren Datenbanken abgefragt werden. On Waiting Out the Storm, Jeremy Ivey apologizes for present society's destruction of the environment and wonders if racism still exists in the future and whether people still get high and have mental health issues. 	                       Non mainstream black – not into violence, takes a subdued, pacifistic approach. This scene shows the boys’ complete inability to interact with people in a respectful manner, they are unwilling to engage in dialogue or incapable to communicate constructively because they lack the basic social tools. They are positioned in such a way as to literally ‘look down on’ the three friends in a space that resembles a bear pit or zoo enclosure. La Haine centers around class rather than race: though the three main characters come from different ethnic backgrounds, Kassovitz is not interested in the assertion of ethnic identity, but the geography of class and society’s general fear of outsiders. Hi Otman, Thank you for pointing this out. 	                       This is not to say they are idiots. Prove you are human, type cats in singular form below: The Artifice is a long-form writing platform that covers a wide spectrum of art forms. In this world there is no space for self-achievement nor for self-acceptance, the only language […]. Within French society, French police have been known to kill innocent, young, French minorities by accident. La Haine is set in 1990’s Set in outskirts of Paris – Les Banlieues (urban estate). Vinz, Hubert, and Said lead the viewer through the ups and downs of what seem to be a relatively normal day in the projects. The audience is drawn to identify and empathize with them in their desperate, naïve, attempt to survive their victimization and racial exclusion. Kassovitz’s intention was not to want to provide a solution to the problem of social and racial exclusion, but to show an apocalyptic vision of life in the banlieue. Back on their home turf, Vinz is accidentally killed by plain-clothes police and Hubert points a gun at the officer responsible for the death. La Haine, then, remains an important object in French media and culture, which is why it is both interesting and important to investigate today. Vinz (Vincent Cassel) is a Jew who lives with his grandmother and sister, and spends the days away dreaming of how to murder a cop (his impression of Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver is both hilarious and chilling). Cinematographer: Pierre Aim. Not seeing terrorism as a social dysfunction he questioned Muslims’ loyalty suggesting that they “deserve to be the victim of this confusion” if they failed to make themselves adequately heard. La Haine has its moments of physical violence. The scapegoats for all the country’s problems. Techniques such as these are employed to give a rounded picture of the life of marginalised young people in Paris, and yet at the same time to create a film that sits relatively comfortably within the context of popular cinema. We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website. Because they have moved marginally we experience the cut as a jolt. Vinz, Saïd and Hubert speak largely in “verlan”, a French vernacular that functions on switching syllable orders. He thinks violence is the only way to get the respect he deserves, but ends up revealing a fear of violence underneath his apparent aggressiveness. It was impactful to see both how the boys reacted to the story, and to the old man specifically, and the applicability of the old man’s story to the boy’s lives as well, which is of course his intention, as he overheard them in the bathroom while they were arguing. It’s real, it’s happening, and people are dying. God I love this film! Watching Kassovitz’s surprise and joy upon receiving the Best Director award in Cannes has a bittersweet taste, considering how serious and demanding he seems in modern interviews. The Routledge Encyclopedia of Films, Edited by Sarah Barrow, Sabine Haenni and John White, first published in 2015. The ethnic origins of our three central characters, Said, Vinz and Hubert, are made clear from the outset: Said is Arab African–French (Beur), Vinz has a Jewish background and Hubert is black African– French. The object of attention is ghetto existence as such. Its stunning black and white cinematography achieves the violent beauty that demands our attention while pleasuring our senses. In turning the camera on himself, even in his most vulnerable moments as a sick and dying man, filmmaker and activist Marlon Riggs demonstrated the futility of divorcing the personal from the political. 	  Sozialer Brennpunkt,                        In most films, present action supersedes future consequence. One of recent cinema’s best executed time bombs. The title of the film actually derives from a line spoken by Hubert: “La haine attire la haine !” “Hatred breeds hatred.”. l e h r e r - o n l i n e . One of the most powerful films in the history of modern French cinema, La Haine caused a huge stir when it opened the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. Sometimes the power of understatement is what it takes to point out something so egregious that it would be far better if it weren’t true. But I would let his art and actions speak for himself and not get stuck on one tweet. My late French professor, Mr. Kight, who turned me on to this, confessed to the class that even he had to watch this with subtitles. The director dedicated the film to all those who perished during these riots while the film was being made. La Haine is never accusatory or stereotypical, instead within its conception of modern life as pure hell, it also reminds us that life can contain moments of utter beauty. The characters are not fundamentally bad people, not criminals, nor particularly violent. The situation is what it is, and we must try and stand against petty generalizations, but they do exist. Violence affects everything that happens to people in the suburbs, and it’s cost is staggering. One of the more immediate effects of the monochromatic choice of colors is the more serious tone of the film. The film has been converted to HD with breathtaking results and the roster of extras included might just turn this into the ultimate edition of the film. Country singer-songwriter Rachel Brooke reflects on life in a small town where winters are long and comforts can be few in "The Lovells Stockade Blues". They journey into the centre of Paris and then back out to the working-class satellite town where they live, and as they do so they are confronted firstly by the well-to-do middle class, then by racist elements in the police force, and finally by right-wing skinheads. Great page Virginia! Kassovitz was 27 when he directed La Haine, and you can feel the vibrant passion with which every scene and every line in the screenplay were conceived. He described how his friend went for a shit when allowed off a train during the deportations of World War 2. She currently works as a story editor at Golden Hour Films s.rl, an independent production company in Rome where she collaborates with other freelance writers on Italian as well as international projects.
