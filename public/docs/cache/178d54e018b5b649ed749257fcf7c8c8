By using our Services or clicking I agree, you agree to our use of cookies. There was a problem. The reason they killed HOTS was because HOTS was dead on arrival, and this is coming from an Alpha player. To do that, you have to really zoom in on each individual move and break it down in detail. We finished between top 10 and top 50 in legend rank every season, Â so from that aspect it was pretty cool. Close. That means if an average game would have lasted until turn 8 or 9 on average, that's turn 7 now. If Amnesiac was quitting because he had issues with Blizzard he wouldn't shy away from that. In every other respect, I was your average 13-year-old who enjoyed playing sports and that kind of stuff. there is no reason someone, and especially a person like amnesiac, who quits a game would shy away from criticizing the game/company if they were the cause. So we were thinking about quitting Hearthstone, but we also loved Hearthstone and had a lot of positive associations with it. I think the game used to take a lot more skill and had far more decision making. Amnesiac: I donât know if Iâd want to commit everything to the game, but I think I play at a professional level at the moment and Iâd like to compete at that level. https://twitter.com/Amnesiac_HS/status/1211676924415750145, And the link directly to the post: https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sr3rhg. I started to take notice of him because I saw pros talking about this kid who was insanely good at Druid, which is my class of choice. That definitely sounds like something the Young Savage would do. You hear what I'm talking about. William Barton is fast becoming a big deal in the Hearthstone competitive scene, where he plays under the name Amnesiac. Please refresh the page and try again. Suddenly, it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt something I was embarrassed to tell people about. It only takes a few matches of people leaving and them getting replaced with AI for a newbie to just fuck right off. I didnât even know it was possible to go pro. I just believe the game is going in the wrong direction and until I see that there is real effort in order to improve the competitive scene, or just some advantages for the competitive scene, I won't change this opinion, which is basically that they care very much for the casual player experience, but not much for the competitive player. Did this feeling creep up on you? Cookies help us deliver our Services. Channing Frye and Iman Shumpert are back to explain the stakes, place bets and analyze the most valuable players in the NBA Finals. Calling it now: Amnesiasc will quit Hearthstone after Blizzcon. Amnesiac was the only GM last year who was forced to forfeit a match because he couldn't show up, and I'm honestly impressed it was only one. Same with Orange and Zalae. Killed a game entirely (HOTS). ThereÃ¢ÂÂs just so much to know. And it just so happens that when youÃ¢ÂÂre in middle school you haveÃÂ a lotÃÂ of free time Ã¢ÂÂ youÃ¢ÂÂre not old enough to go out, but you are old enough to feel really bored. I cannot beat that card. 985. All other games are not a priority as far as esports goes, which even includes the original esport that is Starcraft. If they have, IÃ¢ÂÂll tell them that itÃ¢ÂÂs like an online version of that. The End. Instead IÃ¢ÂÂd meticulously level-up each of my PokÃÂ©mon until I had 20 unbeatable ones. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs when Hearthstone became much more than a hobby. Now IÃ¢ÂÂm one of eight players competing in the $1 million Hearthstone World Championship. Amnesiac: I get along really well with basically everybody on the team. Iâd never go into a best of five thinking I canât win. The more games you play, the more reward you get. That poly babble pull was retarted and you know it. Diablo 3 was a shitshow at release, then became a good game after it was patched a few million times. You have no resources on the board whatsoever, you have only a few Mana to interact with, and also not a big combination of cards to pick from. Amnesiac is just 14 years old. Looking back, which era of Hearthstone was its healthiest? ThatÃ¢ÂÂs kind of how it goes when youÃ¢ÂÂre 16. And then when TGT came out, it was a little bit awkward because I wanted to test my ideas on ladder, but it didnât make a ton of sense to queue up unrefined decks at rank 1 legend. Meet the 15-year-old Hearthstone pro whoâs teaching veterans a thing or two. You can almost never count on maly drop bb-poly. Amnesiac: It must have been when I was 12, I guess. Saying that he should "play a different deck" or "not player 7 hours in a row" is the same as saying he should quit being a pro player. I would love to play competitive Hearthstone, that's not the issue. [Blizzard] care very much for the casual player experience, but not much for the competitive player. I would quit, too, after winning 50k at age 16 for playing cards, because it's clearly not worth my time. However, after his victory, nearly everyone knew, and the community was quick to embrace Amnesiacâ¦ Do you think there could be anything in the Journey to UnâGoro expansion that might lure you back to playing competitively. I mean, it's one of the most obvious PR things to do for your image. The decision by Adrian âLifecoachâ Koy to stop playing Hearthstone competitively was a significant blow to Blizzardâs game, which already struggles to be taken seriously as an esport. Riots card game is gonna take a huge chunk of people who want some semblance of complexity and decision making from their game and their pay model is going to make Hearthstones look like a joke. Unpopular opinion, but comp HotS was garbage for how the game was balanced. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not like I started playingÃÂ HearthstoneÃÂ with this goal of becoming one of the best players in the world. At school very few people know I play videogames, and at home it comes up occasionally, but not really. We would like to show you a description here but the site wonât allow us. Sure, but it would be a little unfair to say. And I helped Xixo with his preparation, before he was released from the team, for the Archon Team League Championships so I get along with him as well. And at the moment, talking about competitive Hearthstone, the question is always when can you call a game competitive? Search. At some point eventually the breakthrough happened. Sometimes there are little spikes, if you have an upswing, but if you take upswings out, the edge probably halves, which is tremendous in terms of any kind of measurement. I think I won like 15 games in a row before I faced a Hunter who played a Leper Gnome. Having tracked down Amnesiacâs stream, I was startled at how articulate he is and by his ability to read matches. Press question mark to learn the rest of the keyboard shortcuts, https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sr3rhg. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not about having a quick-twitch or insane APM. Compared to games like CSGO and Dota and even OW, Hearthstone seems to trigger it's pros a lot more than those other games. It's quantity over quality. Wasnât there always a danger that with this aggressive approach youâd burn yourselves out? ItÃ¢ÂÂs more about learning the game as you go, and using every piece of knowledge you have to improve for the next series. Both games require somewhat similar skills in that youÃ¢ÂÂre not only playing your cards, but youÃ¢ÂÂre also anticipating your opponentÃ¢ÂÂs cards. It began with Sunshine Hunter, which unfortunately was nerfed. Itâs kind of hard to explainâ¦ I donât bring it up very much. He played a card ben fucking moron brode slapped random onto the text of and it let him win. Thank you for signing up to PC Gamer. If you can achieve a 1% edge, then it's kind of coin-flipping. His Twitch stream can be found here and you can also follow him on Twitter. Pavel took a huge risk in his line of play against that rag, that wasn't just luck it was a punish. As an inveterate Hearthstone addict, Tim spends most of his time trying to explain why all Priest players are degenerates. Present tense. IÃ¢ÂÂm pretty happy about it because itÃ¢ÂÂs a sick nickname.
