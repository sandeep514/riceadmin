At the culmination of the 2005–06 season, Orient earned promotion to the third tier of English league football (League One), their first automatic promotion since the 1969–70 season. "The whole season's been a big factor with what's gone on, but the boys in the last few performances have got out on the pitch and put in some good performances.". The fans trust coordinated protests against the owner at the time between 2017 and 2019 at Blackpool F.C. "Most fans understand I will only do what is right for the club," Hearn said.  In the early 1970s, looking for a property investment, Hearn bought a snooker hall in Romford, Greater London. The O's have increasingly been forced to rely on their younger players, with seven teenagers included in the starting line-up in the loss to Crewe. Before Hearn's takeover the club was facing a financial disaster due to the collapse of the then chairman Tony Wood's coffee business in Rwanda at the time of the Rwandan genocide. [3] After nearly going bankrupt in the early 1990s, and suffering a heart attack in 2002, he returned and has become a multi-millionaire. All rights reserved. Former Leyton Orient owner Barry Hearn says he now regrets selling the club to businessman Francesco Becchetti.

It was like looking at Barry Hearn 20 years ago - but with more money. Should Becchetti not pay the tax bill before the court date, then at the winding-up hearing the fans would seek the appointment of an administrator, despite the fact it would mean the club being deducted 12 points under English Football League rules.

"The moment that owner is no longer there it's a different question and I'm available to help wherever I can.". "I'm not prepared to put up with this sort of thing at a club my name is associated with," he added.

I felt a synergy with him. [5] The commercial business was separated from the regulatory body, the WPBSA. He formed a new firm, Kensal House Investments, and DHA became Deryck Healey International (DHI). On 19 April, a statement from staff said they were "hugely concerned" by the "lack of communication" from the club's hierarchy. Before Hearn's takeover the club was facing a financial disaster due to the collapse of the then chairman Tony Wood's coffee business in Rwanda at the time of the Rwandan genocide.

People can't focus on their jobs properly and it's been tough. Owner Francesco Becchetti has been given until 12 June to sell the club or pay off his debts to creditors.
