A man hits another man in the head with a kettle-like object, before putting an axe to his head, presumably killing him (the impact is offscreen). The remote, desolate lighthouse that Winslow (Robert Pattinson) moves into at the start of the film would be foreboding enough without those dreary, shuddering honks. Dafoe’s so much fun to watch here you almost don’t notice how adept Pattinson is at playing multiple levels of mounting frustration, until he too finally gets his turn to explode. It smacks of the Greek myth of Prometheus, who, too, desires fire and is punished for tricking Zeus in the end. Dafoe’s Wake is a little harder to pin down. The Robert Pattinson Movies Batman Fans Need to See. (This is implied to be a dream or a vision.). No, not the Marvel and DC comics mash-up we’ve all been secretly waiting for. All rights reserved. Eric Chakeen / A24 / The Everett Collection. Plot Summary Or is Eggers just exploring the mania of isolation, the violent urges that can come with loneliness and sexual repression out in the middle of nowhere? Sean Burns Twitter Film CriticSean Burns is a film critic for The ARTery. Taglines But with The Lighthouse (out Friday), written with his brother Max, the director sharpens his talent for capturing period-specific (19th century in this instance) horror that reveals man’s chronic perverseness. The movie has just two speaking characters: Set in the 1890s, it follows Winslow, a “wickie,” or lighthouse keeper, who begins a duty shift under the supervision of the salty sea dog Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe). He leaves those questions to the audience, but The Lighthouse doesn’t feel like a tease, nor is it half-baked. Several dead gulls in water. Brief shot of woman's bare breasts lasting about 2-3 seconds. Genres : Drama, Thriller, Horror Platforms : Theater Directed by Chris Crow. Talacre Lighthouse. Eggers, who also made The Witch, creates such a complete picture of the past that it almost feels like the movie was actually filmed there. A man forces another man to act like a dog and bark while on a leash and almost burys the man alive. The Lighthouse is a hypnotic and hallucinatory tale of two lighthouse keepers on a remote and mysterious New England island in the 1890s. Winslow and Wake’s interactions are warm at times, murderously venomous at others; there’s great humor to both Dafoe’s and Pattinson’s performances as they butt heads, sing songs and dance together, and argue vigorously about the quality of Wake’s cooking. Edit . In particular, Dafoe, whose character jauntily recites ancient sea poetry through a clenched wooden pipe, gets several long takes so ferocious that they may demand to be studied in future acting classes. Eggers and ace cinematographer Jarin Blaschke shoot in the almost-square 1.19 aspect ratio — a screen size seldom used since the silent era — using vintage 1930s lenses on contemporary cameras to add to the picture’s woozy sense of temporal displacement. It's the 1890s, the work is hard, and the weather is wet and gray. It isn’t horrifying enough that these two men are trapped on an island with their carnal urges and needs without modern day plumbing. But the way Eggers shoots and scores this movie, Winslow might as well be crossing into the underworld. Families can talk about The Lighthouse's violence. A man plunges an axe into another man's shoulder. Are Winslow and Wake in hell, or perhaps at some way station en route to it? Add your ratingSee all 11 parent reviews. The Parents Guide items below may give away important plot points. There are allusions to ancient ocean legends and fabled curses copped from Herman Melville and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, but beneath all the mythological bluster it’s really a movie about two guys living too close together and driving each other slowly, spectacularly insane. A man is implied to be masturbating in a room above where a character is standing. Tons of blood sprays and starts pouring down his body. Wake treats Winslow without mercy during the day, but at night, he talks to and tries to ply him with liquor, to loosen him up. Hangovers. He’s practically a flesh-and-blood extension of the lighthouse itself, to the extent that his beard seems like it should be made of barnacles—and he quickly subjects Winslow to a grueling life of hard labor at the ends of the earth.     |                         More scary than graphic. It’s clear from the jump that Wake knows more than he’s leading Howard to believe. A horror movie about having a roommate, writer-director Robert Eggers’ striking sophomore effort “The Lighthouse” is a visually arresting wallow in … Winslow, it turns out, is really named Thomas Howard; he’s a man who fled his home after a not-so-mysterious lumber accident. But it has that same attention to detail that makes Eggers such an exciting filmmaker. The Lighthouse is a hypnotic and hallucinatory tale of two lighthouse keepers on a remote and mysterious New England island in the 1890s. Characters drink frequently, often to extreme drunkenness (and hangovers), and smoke cigarettes and pipes. A man discovers a naked woman and caresses and explores her face, neck, then breasts. Two men try to choke each other to death and get into a brawl. Lovecraft, the best Horror movies on Netflix right now, Things Ghost of Tsushima Doesn't Tell You. It’s a bracing squall of a movie, a briny delight that’s as amusing as it is mesmerizingly strange. And speaking of that crank: there certainly exists a... sexual tension between these two men, which, frankly is just naturally bound to cross one’s mind if you’re stuck on an island for more than a minute. The violence (while in black in white) is still disturbing because of the tone the film sets. Shot in black-and-white and presented in a boxy Academy aspect ratio, The Lighthouse looks like a throwback while sounding disarmingly modern, driven by the wailing soundtrack and Mark Korven’s discordant score. Multiple, fairly long, scenes depicting masturbation. The Lighthouse is a very well made psychological thriller that builds as it goes along. One of the characters is frequently seen smoking a pipe. Cigarette and pipe smoking. After capturing the gruesome and god-fearing hysteria of witchcraft in his 2016 debut, The Witch, it was clear he already had a firm (and twisted) grasp on the supernatural. Such sly, self-conscious flourishes are what make “The Lighthouse” feel like the world’s most elaborate penis joke, cackling at the elongated, erect title structure and the seamen stuck inside, ready to blow. We were unable to submit your evaluation. He’s a cross between Proteus (the old protector of the sea and its livestock) and Poseidon, so much so that Howard sometimes sees Wake depicted with tentacles and a crown of coral. Close. Join now. Theirs is a world without privacy nor a moment’s peace, stealing away for furtive bouts of self-pleasure while living amid a fusillade of farts and other gassy emissions. It's excellent, though deeply unsettling. In THE LIGHTHOUSE, Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) arrives for work as an assistant lighthouse keeper, working under salty old seaman Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe). His entire body is covered in blood. A seemingly never-ending storm begins to rage, and Winslow becomes obsessed with finding out why Wake never lets anyone into the locked upper lighthouse beacon. What's the appeal of scary movies? There’s some sort of strange, unholy power up there in all that illumination, but Ephraim is to remain downstairs scrubbing the floors and whitewashing the walls, bearing the brunt of Wake’s constant insults and colorful invective. From award-winning writing and photography to binge-ready videos to electric live events, GQ meets millions of modern men where they live, creating the moments that create conversations. In The Witch, Eggers showed a real talent for period detail, conjuring unsettling imagery from the simplest choices of set design. There's also some sex-related talk in addition to strong language like "s--t," "bitch," "bastard," and "goddamn." The end result, without spoiling things, is fabulously unnerving. The Lighthouse First Reviews: An "Explosively Scary" Visual Treat From the Director of The Witch The first reviews out of Cannes say Robert Eggers' latest comes packed with tension, beauty, and dynamite performances from Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe. His behind is shown in a non-sexual way. Blood spatters each time the seagulls body hits the pavement. The lighthouse is a black and white indie horror film about two lighthouse keepers are spend weeks on a island. And it’s funny, too! Fairly infrequent uses of "s--t," "horses--t," "son of a bitch" "bastard," "damn," "hell," "goddamn," "pecker," "stupid," "anus," "jism.". How is drinking depicted? Winslow crosses paths with a malevolent seagull, promising bad omens. It’s a well-crafted effort, but even among horror fans, it won’t be for everyone.
