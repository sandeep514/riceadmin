On 10 September 1892 Leicester played their first game at Welford Road  against a Leicestershire XV. Three Leicester Tigers players were members of the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final winning England side including captain Martin Johnson. The first was Jack Miles who was selected for England in 1903, Leicester's first non-English international was Scotland's Jock Lawrie in 1924. To celebrate the club's centenary a six-match tour to Australia and Fiji was arranged in August 1980, the first undertaken by an English club in the southern hemisphere. Former centre Howard had returned to the club as head coach, working in a coaching team with other former Tigers players Richard Cockerill, Neil Back and Graham Rowntree as they chased a return to the glory days at the turn of the century. [35]  That summer Martin Johnson was named captain for the 2001 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, becoming the first man to lead two tours. The death of Tom Crumbie in 1928 saw Eric Thorneloe take over as Honorary Secretary and by 1930 Tigers had become radio stars with the first BBC broadcast from Welford Road as Leicester beat Waterloo 21-5. In the 2012 final Harlequins beat Leicester 30-23. Tigers' third successive Premiership title was sealed early on 17 March 2001. The ground was opened in 1892 and the first stands accommodated 3,000 spectators. [33]  In the 2001 Heineken Cup final Tigers beat Stade Francais 34-30 to secure the club's first continental title. The 1995/96 season was another of just missing out to perennial rivals Bath who secured a league and cup double after defeating Leicester in the Pilkington Cup final. Only six year later Paul Dodge became the first graduate to win an international cap. [73]  On 29 June it was reported that the pay dispute which started in April could result in several players leaving the club after refusing to cut their pay,[74] with 5 players including Manu Tuilagi and Telusa Veainu leaving later that week after refusing to amend their contracts in light of the global pandemic.[73]. [18]  Chalkie White became coach in 1968; the same season Tom Berry became Leicester's first President of the RFU. [5][6]  Tigers first silverware was the Midlands Counties Cup won for the first time in 1898 against Moseley. 1936: Bernard Gadney, Alexander Obolensky, Charles Beamish Leicester won 4-0 but then lost on their first trip abroad with the visit to Paris a year later. On 27 February 2015 Tigers announced plans to continue the redevelopment of Welford Road by replacing the clubhouse and temporary West Stand with a new permanent building with a 3,100 capacity. They had taken up a vacant spot after a regular fixture with Scottish team Fettes-Lorettonians was cancelled. Leicester became the first side to retain a European title after beating Munster 15-9 in the 2002 Heineken Cup Final. [51], The next year Northampton beat Tigers 21-20 in the Premiership semi final at Franklin's Gardens. In Leicester's debut season in the Heineken Cup the team reached the final, losing 28-9 against Brive. [14], Tigers first televised game by the BBC was on 3 February 1951 when they beat London Scottish 14-0 at the Richmond Athletic Ground. Dusty Hare is the club's all-time highest points scorer with 4,507 between 1976 and 1989. 1903: Alfred Hind, †Ben Youngs was selected to tour for a second time in 2017, but turned down the offer for family reasons.[101]. The Early Year – 1990s. 2005: Julian White, Ben Kay, Lewis Moody, Geordan Murphy, Ollie Smith Leicester last won the Premiership Rugby title in the 2013 and appeared in a record nine successive Premiership finals, from 2005 to 2013. [58][59] In the 2017-18 season successive home defeats to Northampton and Newcastle in Leicester's final two home games saw Tigers miss the play offs for the first time since 2005. A new stand (which became the Crumbie Stand) was opened on October 2, 1920 and terraces were added to the front of it a year later, while the extension of the Members Stand on the opposite side gave a seating capacity at Welford Road of 10,250. [19], The 1971/72 season saw changes which would radically change both the club and the game. [66], On 16 March 2020 the 2019-20 Premiership Rugby season was suspended for 5 weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom,[67] with group training suspended indefinitely on 23 March. This brought the club's total to six championships, tying Bath's record. This time just three points separated the teams with the Irishmen lifting the trophy for the first time. It wasn't until 1895 when the club switched to their famous scarlet, green and white colours for the first ti… : This category contains players who have played for English rugby union team Leicester Football Club (Leicester Tigers) past and present.. For a list of those selected for international rugby whilst at the club see List of Leicester Tigers players selected for International rugby Pat Howard succeeded Wells as coach. At the end of the 2008–09 season three home games were played at the King Power Stadium, then known as the Walkers Stadium, due to demolition of the old north stand. Tigers retained the Midlands Merit Table title in November with an undefeated record. England fly-half Phil Horrocks-Taylor, a Lions tourist in 1959, and Ireland’s flamboyant Tony O’Reilly added their own class to the squad, while Matthews became such a consistent and influential figure that he would go on to set an appearance record for the club which will never be beaten. Tigers had lost just once – at Orrell – in the 10-game league programme. Tigers, with Martin Johnson as captain, won four successive league titles from 1999-2002, were crowned kings of Europe in 2001 and 2002, and for good measure also added a Zurich Championship when the authorities decided to add a play-off to the end of the league season. At Christmas 1921, Tigers entertained their first French visitors, from the Racing Club de France (later to return to the top table of European rugby as Racing Metro and Racing 92). An inauspicious debut fixture against Moseley ended 0-0 at the Belgrave Cricket and Cycle Ground on October 23, with Leicester adopting black as the club colours and becoming known as “The Death or Glory Boys”. By the 1950s, however, club president Billy Bradshaw warned that considerable economies would be required to tackle the debts in the face of falling attendances and the counter-attraction of county fixtures at weekends. The Leicester Football Club was formed from an amalgamation of three clubs – Leicester Societies AFC, Leicester Amateur FC and Leicester Alert – at the George Hotel in Leicester on August 3, 1880 and staged it first match just 12 weeks later. [81], This tradition lasted until 1998 when Premiership Rugby rules forced Leicester to abandon lettering and Tigers first wore numbers on 5 September 1998 against Harlequins at Welford Road.[81]. [48], Domestic success continued with Tigers reaching Premiership finals but losing in 2011 and 2012, against Saracens and Harlequins respectively, and winning the 2012 LV Cup. 150 players from 14 different nations have been selected to represent their national side whilst a member of Leicester. 1974: Alan Old The Tigers' current kit was launched on 11 September 2019[87] and features Leicester's traditional green, red and white stripes. Tigers' very first kit was black with white shorts and black socks, with the club's crest in the centre of the chest. The RFU introduced a national Knockout Cup competition for clubs and on 16 November 1971 Tigers played their first competitive cup match since 1914, a 10-3 defeat to Nottingham at their Beeston ground. It was the dawn of a new golden era in the club’s history. Wikimedia Commons has media related to Players of Leicester Tigers. They couldn’t help Tigers to success in their first venture in the RFU national knockout competition, losing to Notts in the first round of 1971/72, but the trophy became a central focus in the club’s growth. [64], After a delayed start to the season due to the 2019 Rugby World Cup Tigers fortunes did not improve, and on 21 January 2020 it was announced after months of speculation that England's forwards coach Steve Borthwick would join the club as head coach once his duties with England were finished. Leicester finished as Courage League champion in 1994–95. The fixture became a vital feature in the club's calendar delivering large attendances until open professionalism and league rugby in the 1990s forced it to gradually be abandoned due to fixture congestion. 1959: Tony O'Reilly, Phil Horrocks-Taylor [47]  After an historic placing kicking competition decided the 2009 Heineken cup semi-final, Leicester lost the 2009 Heineken Cup Final to Irish province Leinster. [62] Murphy was then made the permanent head coach on 18 December 2018 despite the team being on an eight match losing run. The Leicester Tigers senior squad for the 2020–21 season is:[99]. Tigers made a first TV appearance in a 14-0 win over London Scottish at the Richmond Athletic Ground in February 1951 and in another groundbreaking move Major Albert Chilton became the club’s first paid official, on a salary of £250 a year as general secretary as the club celebrated its 75th birthday. Four players were selected to tour with the 1930 British Isles party, including captain Doug Prentice, and the following year a Leicestershire & East Midlands XV including seven Tigers inflicted the only defeat on the touring Springboks. [90]  The clubhouse was built on the Aylestone Road end in 1909,[9] the Members' & Crumbie Stands were built just before and just after the First World War respectively. The club's first non-British or Irish player selected for international duty was Canada's Dave Lougheed when he played against USA in August 1998. Leicester approached the late 1950s with a fresh optimism, not least with the adoption of an Extra First XV and Swifts team to increase playing resources, while the increasingly important input of New Zealander Colin Martin played a central role in driving the team forward. The work was completed for the first home game of the 2009-10 season against Newcastle Falcons.[96]. Leicester have participated 13 of the last 15 Premiership Play Offs, reaching nine consecutive finals between 2005 and 2013. But they returned to win their first silverware in 1898, beating Moseley 5-3, before extending their winning run over the next seven seasons until withdrawing “to give other teams a chance”. The name of the Leicester club began to travel far and wide, with John Jackett, Fred Jackson and Tom Smith becoming the first players to join an overseas tour when they were selected for an Anglo-Welsh party (a forerunner of the British & Irish Lions) for the trip to Australia in 1907/08. The replacement of old buildings and temporary seating at the Clubhouse End with a new stand for the 2015/16 season took capacity to 25,849 and Tigers reached the semi-finals of Premiership and European competition with former centre Aaron Mauger operating as head coach with director of rugby Cockerill. Crumbie has been credited with dr… [92] However, after several months of talks, the two clubs ended any ground share plans in July 2005. By the time Obolensky became the first England international to be killed in the Second World War – when his Hawker Hurricane crashed during a training exercise – his name was already in English rugby folklore. Players in the era swore a loyalty to him and his methods, and the results were there for all to see on the pitch. Tigers lost only one match all season and the end of the 1987–88 season Tigers became England's first official champions. The first known use of the name was after a game against Bedford School in February 1885, the Leicester Daily Post reporting that "the Tiger stripes were keeping well together". * In 2001 & 2002 the winners of the league were considered champions with the winners of the play offs considered champions from 2003 onward.
