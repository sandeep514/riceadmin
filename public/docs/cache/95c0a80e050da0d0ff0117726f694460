Anything can happen in the NBA nowadays, and of course, some organizations have been linked to Antetokounmpo. Ariza could be dealt to Milwaukee to balance out the salary cap hit of Antetokounmpo’s contract. The takeaways from this whole exercise should be two-fold. and the Bucks have just guaranteed their future sans Giannis. The projected first overall pick gives them something to build on in years to come, with Green, Middleton, Bledsoe, and Brook Lopez all aged 28 or above. They will, however, need to send over their 2020 first-round pick (projected to be the first overall pick) and their 2021 first-round pick (Top 3 protected; acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of the Wiggins deal). Draft picks will be involved in the blockbuster trade. Green is another key piece in the Dubs championship sides, but it could be argued that Thompson provides more value than Green. This Sunday’s episodes of The Last Dance also gave us our first extended look at Toni Kukoc, a player who would have been absolutely incredible in today’s NBA.

In addition, the Bucks have spent years building this roster around him and his talents and merging timelines to open their championship window now. Milwaukee gets Simmons, an elite defender who can play a similar role (albeit less effectively) than Giannis, maintaining the basic integrity of Mike Budenholzer’s system at both ends. <br> <br>Golden State has been identified as the team that might be willing to break the bank to sign the reigning MVP. The most plausible scenarios for resuming the 2019-20 NBA season will likely require shortening the NBA playoffs and probably playing games at neutral sites.
