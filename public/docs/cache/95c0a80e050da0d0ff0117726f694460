The probable player to be on the move between the two is Siakam. <br> <br>In order to post comments, please make sure JavaScript and Cookies are enabled, and reload the page. Anything can happen in the NBA nowadays, and of course, some organizations have been linked to Antetokounmpo. Ariza could be dealt to Milwaukee to balance out the salary cap hit of Antetokounmpoâ€™s contract. The takeaways from this whole exercise should be two-fold. and the Bucks have just guaranteed their future sans Giannis. The projected first overall pick gives them something to build on in years to come, with Green, Middleton, Bledsoe, and Brook Lopez all aged 28 or above. They will, however, need to send over their 2020 first-round pick (projected to be the first overall pick) and their 2021 first-round pick (Top 3 protected; acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of the Wiggins deal). Draft picks will be involved in the blockbuster trade. Green is another key piece in the Dubs championship sides, but it could be argued that Thompson provides more value than Green. This Sundayâ€™s episodes of The Last Dance also gave us our first extended look at Toni Kukoc, a player who would have been absolutely incredible in todayâ€™s NBA. The Trail Blazers will definitely have to package up picks for Antetokounmpo even if they include CJ McCollum in the deal. Guards Will Barton and MontÃ© Morris could also be in consideration. If Giannis signs his option the that would be a possibility for the Heat to make up his massive contract. Draft picks will be involved in the blockbuster trade. This is the hypothetical Bleacher-Report offered up â€” Wiggins, the Warriorsâ€™ 2020 first-round pick, the Timberwolvesâ€™ 2021 first-round pick (top-three-protected) and the Warriorsâ€™ 2022 first-round pick. <br> <br>Klay Thompson as emerged as the biggest piece that might need to be moved in a potential Giannis coup. This scenario is definitely not the most popular but both teams can benefit right away from a trade. There is no way the Warriors can land Giannis without parting ways with a number of significant assets. In addition, the Bucks have spent years building this roster around him and his talents and merging timelines to open their championship window now. Milwaukee gets Simmons, an elite defender who can play a similar role (albeit less effectively) than Giannis, maintaining the basic integrity of Mike Budenholzerâ€™s system at both ends. <br> <br>Golden State has been identified as the team that might be willing to break the bank to sign the reigning MVP. The most plausible scenarios for resuming the 2019-20 NBA season will likely require shortening the NBA playoffs and probably playing games at neutral sites. Giannis Antetokounmpo leaving the Milwaukee Bucks to sign with the Golden State Warriors â€” it sounded completely absurd at first.

In any deal that Toronto comes up with, draft selections will most definitely be involved.  <br>Share on Pinterest. Post was not sent - check your email addresses! Heâ€™s still tall and still blocks shots but heâ€™s really just a spot-up threat on offense which means the Bucks would be trading Giannis for a slightly souped-up Brook Lopez. Denver needs to improve their defense and they need to immediately.

Close â€¢ Posted by 29 minutes ago. <br> At just 25, Wiggins still has some star potential left, and he could be a very good player for Milwaukee over the next few years. Point guard Kenrick Nunn could also be in a trade conversation for Giannis. <br> <br>Click here for instructions on how to enable JavaScript in your browser. So this is where all this talk is coming from. <br> <br>The same goes for the Bucks, who reportedly have every intention of offering him a max deal â€” possibly the biggest contract in NBA history â€” as soon as he becomes eligible to sign an extension in the offseason. The Heat have all the momentum in the world after beating the Bucks in the Eastern Conference semifinals. <br> <br>1) Boston: 17 Brooklyn, 18 Brooklyn, Jaylen Brown, any other choice (e.g. The second is that there arenâ€™t any scenarios that return equal value to the Bucks. <br> <br>Copyright Â© ClutchPoints. Curious because I want to see those 2 play together. Three first-round picks sound like a lot but given the scenario here, thereâ€™s just not much capital being offered.

The more they wait, the more his value decreases. If Giannis gets traded this offseason, there is a chance that he doesnâ€™t stay with his new team. Michael Porter Jr., who recently broke out in the NBAâ€™s bubble, would probably be the young star that Denver has to give up. And until he signs the max extension the Bucks will undoubtedly offer him whenever the 2020 offseason occurs, heâ€™s also a hypothetical trade target. <br> <br>If you just want to skip to the good stuff, check outÂ the best quotesÂ andÂ biggest revelations.

Which is why itâ€™s only going to happen if Giannis basically tells them they have to. <br> <br>Golden State Warriors,â€™ forwards, Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green could also be considered in a possible trade. <br> <br>What are some potentitial giannis trade packages for the sixers to consider?
