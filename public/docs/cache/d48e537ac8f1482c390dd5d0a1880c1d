[7], Around 3:00 AM, Miyano took Furuta to a nearby park, where Minato, Ogura, and Watanabe were waiting. </p> <p>Please rest in peace ...[23], Furuta's intended future employer presented her parents with the uniform she would have worn in the position she had accepted.

[29] It has also been reported that Ogura had depleted his father's savings, money which was intended to be provided as restitution to Furuta's family, buying and consuming a number of luxury goods. The murder case of Junko Furuta is officially known as the “Concrete-encased high school girl murder case,” considering as one of the worst crimes ever committed in human history. Explore the world of strange and unexplained things, creepy stories, true crimes, dark history, paranormal happenings and many more. They were beating and humiliating her every day in a more and more inhumane way. Nobuharu Minato’s brother was also aware of the situation, but did nothing to prevent it. They poured lighter fluid onto her thighs, arms, face, and stomach and once again set her on fire. From the hotel, Hiroshi called Minato and his other friends, Jō Ogura and Yasushi Watanabe, and bragged to them about the rape. On 27 November, Junko’s parents contacted the police about their daughter’s disappearance. [7] The house, which was owned by Minato's parents, soon became their regular gang hangout.[8]. [4] Prior to her abduction, she had accepted a job at an electronics retailer, where she planned on working after graduation. The police found the drum containing Junko’s body the following day. She was a cheerful, studious girl who was more interested in her schooling than drinking or partying. </p> <p>She was unable to move from the ground. On 27 November, Furuta's parents contacted the police about their daughter's disappearance. But soon their parents realized what was actually going on there, however, they didn’t do anything for it. Changed his name to Hiroshi Yokoyama. For this, they punished her by taunting her with a candle flame and finally dousing her legs in lighter fluid and set them on fire, as punishment for trying to run away. From the hotel, Miyano called Minato and his other friends, Jō Ogura and Yasushi Watanabe, and bragged to them about the rape. Furuta was said to slip into unconsciousness because of the repeated assaults, leading them to dunk her head into a bucket of water each time to continue the torture. Junko was also forced to ask her mother to stop the police investigation into her disappearance. In order to prevent a further investigation, the kidnappers forced her to call and say her mother that she had run away, but was safe and staying with a friend. When her wounds and discomfort became noticeable, one of the captors' parents realized she was not who they thought she was. </p> <p>[24][7] He was 16 at the time of the murder. Ogura reportedly asked Miyano to keep her in captivity in order to allow numerous people to sexually assault her. Instead, they forced her to sleep outside on the balcony during winter time and locked her in a freezer. We know it would have become a great place of pilgrimage today. Junko Furuta, a Japanese teenage girl who was kidnapped on November 25, 1988, and was gang-raped and tortured for 41 days until she died on January 4th of 1989 at the age of only 17. She lived with her parents, her elder brother, and her younger brother. At her graduation, Junko Furuta’s school principal presented her parents with her high school graduation certificate and her friends still speak of their time with her. 渥美饒兒『十七歳、悪の履歴書-女子高生コンクリート詰め殺人事件』作品社、2003年。, Learn how and when to remove these template messages, Learn how and when to remove this template message, Cheshire, Connecticut, home invasion murders, https://endia.net/josikouseiconcrete-hannin-genzai, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATs-pJWSqf8, "Japanese Horror Story: The Torture of Junko Furuta", https://president.jp/articles/amp/29649?page=1, https://www.news-postseven.com/archives/20180830_750592.html?DETAIL&_gl=1*1z0yzrp*_ga*ZWZOODFkdHBBR0Z1dVdxb3NFeDlRclFObWFwUkNnY1pVQ0NESUVEYllvTkI0YXlxcXJSZlZXRHlnanVDeVlIVQ, https://matome.naver.jp/m/odai/2135216420298176301, "The 28th Anniversary of the Death of Junko Furuta", https://smart-flash.jp/sociopolitics/49075/amp, https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2018/09110800/?amp=1, "JKコンクリート詰め41日間もまわされ続けた畜生事ｲ牛の全て。犯人達の現在がヤバすぎ・・・ ※実写化 動画あり※", "Chilling Details About The Murder of Junko Furuta AKA The Concrete-Encased High School Girl Murder", https://www.tokyoreporter.com/crime/junko-furuta-killer-again-on-trial-chaos-in-the-courtroom/amp/, https://www.tokyoreporter.com/crime/junko-furuta-killer-arrested-for-attempted-murder-3-decades-later/amp/, "神作譲(小倉譲)の現在は？【再犯】三郷市逮捕監禁致傷事件まとめ！ | 素敵女子の暮らしのバイブルJelly[ジェリー]", "Filme mit Beteiligung von Yujin Kitagawa", https://polka.id/danilla-riyadi-hitam-putih-di-junko-furuta/, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murder_of_Junko_Furuta&oldid=983641712, Articles needing POV-check from July 2010, Articles needing additional references from August 2009, All articles needing additional references, Articles with multiple maintenance issues, Articles containing Japanese-language text, Articles with unsourced statements from March 2020, Articles with unsourced statements from February 2020, Articles needing additional references from August 2018, Find a Grave template with ID not in Wikidata, Articles with Japanese-language sources (ja), Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License, This page was last edited on 15 October 2020, at 11:44. On November 25th, 1988, Furuta was kidnapped by four men on her walk home from school. </p> <p>Despite having a seizure, she lived through the attack, but would not live through a third burning. [7] Miyano, under the pretense of it being a coincidence that he had witnessed this attack, approached Furuta and offered to walk her home safely. Journalists from the Shūkan Bunshun (週刊文春) magazine discovered their identities, however, and published them. Less than twenty-four hours after her death, Minato’s brother called to tell him that Junko appeared to be dead. Skewers of grilled chicken inserted into her vagina and anus, causing bleeding. On 23 January 1989, Hiroshi Miyano and Jō Ogura were arrested for the gang-rape of the 19-year-old woman who they had kidnapped in December. In January 2013, Miyano was re-arrested for fraud. The police were initially puzzled by the confession, as they had been referring to the murder of a different woman and her seven-year-old son that had occurred nine days prior to Furuta's abduction. They burned her vagina and clitoris with cigarettes and lighters, and her eyelids with hot wax. Ihara was allegedly bullied into raping Junko. That case remains unsolved to this day. It was the New Year’s Day of 1989. Ogura reportedly asked Hiroshi to keep her in captivity in order to allow numerous gang members to sexually assault her. Her eardrums were raptured so she couldn’t hear properly, which only made them more angry. She was malnourished and dehydrated due to long starvation. Severe leg burns and badly bruised muscles left her unable to walk. [7] Since she was bleeding profusely, and pus was emerging from her infected burns, the four boys covered their hands in plastic bags, which were taped at the wrists. They inserted foreign objects into her vagina and anus, including a lit light bulb and fireworks. The location near where Furuta's body was discovered has been developed since and is now Wakasu park. </p>";s:7:"keyword";s:23:"junko furuta family now";s:5:"links";s:10242:"<a href='https://ricebrok-staging.webcooks.in/docs/jamie-gilbert-millionaire-86e6ec'>Jamie Gilbert Millionaire</a>,
