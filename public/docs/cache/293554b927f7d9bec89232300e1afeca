The things he lost he didn’t really need; the things he gained couldn’t have come any other way. If our Lord needed to pray this way, how much more do we?

Sometimes we should respond as Jesus once did by saying, “Satan, get thee behind me.” But then we know that Abraham was tempted to slay Isaac as an offering. 1 Peter 5:8-9 says, ” Your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 2.
