Not to such an extent that the schedulers think its appropriate for Christmas Day, but it should be acceptable to more children than the 1978 film and it won’t cause as many nightmares. Not many tots are likely to want to watch a tweedy horror about pagan sacrifice. By using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our. But I don’t see that any of us could possibly have known. Born in a recession, they played Connect Four just for fun and wore corduroy without complaint. Wearied by all they had gone through, the sodden rabbits crouched without talking, incapable of any feeling but a dull relief and without even the energy to wonder what was going to happen next. News, photos, videos and full episode guide. Anyway, what’s a doe more or less?”, Bigwig looked at him in astonishment, but Blackavar, apparently unconcerned either to stress what he had said or to break off the talk, simply began to nibble the grass. “An imaginative faculty is fed as a garden is fed by compost. Are their games violent? They go out over the country—all round the place—living in the open for days at a time. At that moment, in the sunset on Watership Down, there was offered to General Woundwort the opportunity to show whether he was really the leader of vision and genius which he believed himself to be, or whether he was no more than a tyrant with the courage and cunning of a pirate. “One day the farmer thought, ‘I could increase those rabbits: make them part of my farm—their meat, their skins. Nicholas Hoult plays Fiver, the young rabbit with a sixth sense, and James McAvoy is his loyal older brother, Hazel. As the rest fled in all directions he remained where he was, bristling and snarling, bloody-fanged and bloody-clawed. Then the rain fell like a waterfall. “He’d not like any association with the Holocaust. It’s at the midpoint of the scale – your PGs, 12s and 12As – that the BBFC faces the really tough job. He had tried to stop them and he had conspicuously failed. […], “In Efrafa,” said Hyzenthlay, “if a rabbit gave advice and the advice wasn’t accepted, he immediately forgot it and so did everyone else. In escaping Efrafa, Bigwig, Hazel, Fiver, and the others must—as they did at the start of the novel to escape Sandleford—use violence against other rabbits, but this time they do not threaten death or physical harm: they use the elements of nature and allies from the animal world, such as the bird Kehaar and a large dog from a nearby farm, to attack Woundwort and his lackeys. Richard Adams’s source novel about a band of rabbits who escape the destruction of their warren and set off in search of a new home was never intended for a young audience. As you can imagine, Netflix's Watership Down was very different from the 1978 British movie that gave kids nightmares. His own advice had never been given.”. The hedge and the distant trees seemed to leap forward in the brilliance of the flash. Kids haven’t changed, but the BBFC has. JavaScript seems to be disabled in your browser. Episode one begins with a long appraisal of the myth-making of Richard Adams’ universe – how rabbits were given speed to out run their many enemies by the god Frith, how Frith treated the foxes and the birds of prey. Tragically, she was the only hlessi in the group that never reached Watership Down. What message would the daughters of this remarkable author like viewers to take from this new Watership Down? “Go and read the book!”. “Extraordinary!” exclaims Johnson, the more voluble of the pair. […] They had suddenly shown their own cunning greater than his, and left him bewildered on the bank. The rabbits' biting, slapping, scratching and kicking is genuinely upsetting, as the warring communities fight for territory. Blackavar thought what Hazel decided; and whether it turned out later to be right or wrong was all the same. After they unwittingly let their kids watch an animation featuring scenes of bloodied bunnies tearing the merry hell out of each other, a group of parents “slammed” Channel 5’s decision to screen Watership Down on Easter Sunday. Strictly Come Dancing 2020 celebrity line up: meet this year's contestants, Let's play Strictly bingo: 8 things that are bound to happen in this year's series, What’s on TV tonight: Strictly Come Dancing, Everton v Liverpool, Jackie Brown, and more, Truth Seekers: Simon Pegg and Nick Frost on their first sitcom in 20 years, JJ Chalmers: ‘Strictly will be daunting – but I've seen worse’. But the combination of cute cartoon animals and a ‘U’ rating from the British Board of Film Classification meant that a generation were having rabbit-related nightmares long before Glenn Close went near the stockpot in Fatal Attraction. Though Adams has stated that Watership Down is not a metaphor or an allegory, it is easy to see how the violence that permeates the rabbit world mirrors the violence of the human world—and how the mechanisms of fear, manipulation, and both physical and emotional cruelty that Hazel and his friends face are the same which humans must, unfortunately and often, face off against themselves. So, of course, many heads turned when Netflix decided to make their own series of this rabbit refugee adventure. When Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, and their companions initially attempt to leave Sandleford, they meet with Holly, the captain of their warren’s Owsla, or “ruling clique”—essentially, the law enforcement outfit. Find out more, The Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful. It’s a very soggy, wintry morning – not rabbit weather at all. In fact it wasn’t advised at all – he just did it. Crowds of rabbits feeding at morning and evening were likely to attract attention. You need to be a subscriber to join the conversation. One scene, in which the band of rabbits, fleeing destruction of their home burrows, are captured and dragged to the Efrafa warren run by the fearsome General Woundwort has some uncomfortable echoes. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a 12A. The Dexter finale was the worst in TV history: where did it all go wrong? Detailed explanations, analysis, and citation info for every important quote on LitCharts. Richard Adams, Watership Down author, dies aged 96, Watership Down author Richard Adams: I just can’t do humans, Richard Adams: a unique writer whose masterwork made literary history, BBC and Netflix team up for new Watership Down production, Watership Down by Richard Adams: A tale of courage, loyalty, language, The rabbit language of Watership Down helped me make the leap into English. The real mystery of Riviera: who actually watches it. The violence of Watership Down, a children’s film about a group of rabbits trying to find new home, was “arguably too strong”, Austin told the BBC. The Owsla had privileges in regard to feeding, mating and freedom of movement. But Adams was no one-hit wonder. It was a story to entertain his children.”. For one beat of his pulse the lame rabbit’s idea shone clearly before him. We’ve got to go back and get some does out of Efrafa.”, “You might as well say you were going to get them out of Inlé, Hazel-rah. Dogs aren’t dangerous! For his purpose they had to become accustomed to going about in the fields and the wood. The book is dedicated thus: “To Juliet and Rosamond, remembering the road to Stratford-upon-Avon.”. I actually feel a bit cross about this. But yes, rabbits do die in this story and toward the middle of the yarn we do encounter the Black Rabbit of Inlé, the mythical Grim Reaper-type figure of the bunny world who takes rabbits off at their appointed time. It was just because we were in their way. All rights reserved. When we think the BBFC have fouled up, we treat them as if they’re careless child minders, because in a sense, they are. “Your storm, Thlayli-rah. The British Board of Film Classification dangled a carrot to parents outraged by the Easter Sunday broadcast of the bloody bunny saga, saying it would be rated more harshly today. Watership Down’s challenging moments – Fiver the rabbit’s apocalyptic visions, the bloody turf war between rival broods, the Black Rabbit of Inlé (the bunny Grim Reaper) – would wash like so much gore off a mangled pelt.
