Overall things look solid here, detail is nice, colors pop. 				} catch(e) {}, by The film opens with the body of a fisherman washing to shore. The Beast Must Die is a fun time, but for those expecting more of a horror experience Amicus plays this closer to a mystery film than a werewolf film. This event triggers a series of events surrounding crime, revenge…and a wedding. Aside from that the power of the performances and drama really sucked me and really hit this one home. Bahia Blanca surprised, one because I had no idea this was Severin’s mystery title, and two, because as a Jess Franco film I’d never seen I was not expecting something quite like this.

I was wrong to Aenigma is a blast. 	 						_g1 = document.getElementById('g1-logo-mobile-inverted-source'); It wants to be an Agatha Christie style murder mystery, and actually states it’s intention somewhat with an opening narration that puts the question of “Who is the werewolf?” right on the viewer.

When the trailers for Fulci for Fake started showing up, I had oddly assumed we were in for the documentary version of Fulci’s the Cat in the Brain.

Seriously, I wasn’t even expecting to get this film on Blu-ray, and here it is, looking this gorgeous. Fulci and Franco and Beasts, oh my!

Burial Ground (Slipcover) [Severin Films] $21.99. During this sale they are unleashing 2 fine works by Franco, I flipped a coin, and will start with Shining Sex. I didn’t know how to respond, howeve, about 15 minute later, I was able to confirm that this was indeed “the fart movie”.The film is a pretty straight forward and silly premise. Aenigma is a film I came to much later in my Fulci fandom. Lenzi boldly fills the screen with bourgeois depravity, daring sexuality and unnerving twists for the worldwide hit At The Mountain Of Madness calls “so odd, disturbing and well-made, with that delirious giallo feel that’s like a drug.” Lou Castel (.

It has been 20 years now, and Severin’s Blu-ray has given me a great excuse to revisit Demonia. It’s odd there is an outsider consensus that Jess made his best films in the 1970’s, but the more I see of Franco’s 80’s output, and especially that from the early 1980’s the more I quickly push that notion from my head.

Though released theatrically in Italy, Cruel Jaws (aka The Beast) premiered elsewhere on home video. The film actually finds its star in Fulci’s oldest daughter Camilla who expands on her relationship with her Father in a very deep, and very heartfelt manner. Following the international success of Orgasmo, the second Lenzi/Baker collaboration, So Sweet…So Perverse, is a kinky retelling of Diabolique featuring lush Paris locations, trippy flashbacks, a swinging score by Riz Ortolani (Cannibal Holocaust) and an all-star EuroCult cast that includes Jean-Louis Trintignant (The Conformist), Erika Blanc (Kill, Baby…Kill!
