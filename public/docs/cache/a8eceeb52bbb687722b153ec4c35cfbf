[71], To mark a decade since its debut, Anderson and his stars returned to the New York Film Festival for a screening of The Royal Tenenbaums in fall 2011. Afterwards, Royal and Pagoda move out.

The Royal Tenenbaums was shot in and around New York City, including a house in Harlem used for the Tenenbaum residence. Royal Tenenbaums, The.

Royal seems to have improved his relationship with all his children, and seems to be on better terms with Etheline. Eli, with whom Margot has been having an affair, tells her that Richie loves her. [27][95] In 2015, IndieWire named Royal as Anderson's most memorable character, crediting Hackman for bringing the character beyond the director's norm; the same list also named Margot "the ur-Anderson female" character. [58] Professor Dilley identified the setting with the New York City of the 1970s, matching the backdrop style to depictions of the city in the films The French Connection and Midnight Cowboy; this feel is heightened by music popular in the 1970s, by The Rolling Stones and Paul Simon. With a variety of influences, including Louis Malle's 1963 film The Fire Within and Orson Welles' 1942 film The Magnificent Ambersons, the story involves themes of the dysfunctional family, lost greatness, and redemption. [64] For characters who are not biologically Tenenbaums, such as Raleigh, other typefaces are used, such as Helvetica on the covers of the character's books. Richard Schickel of Time wrote, "As with Anderson's Rushmore, there's a certain annoying preciousness to this film—it's not so consistently wise or amusing as he thinks it is—but it has its moments". CNN reported that it had been considered as a possibility for nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Actor for Hackman. "[76] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Etheline calls her children home, and Royal moves back in and sets up medical equipment in Richie's room.

[20], The Waldorf-Astoria was used for the hotel scenes,[20] while Central Park Zoo depicted a rain forest. [60] Author Gustavo Mercado considered the medium shots a tool to give character and surroundings comparable levels of attention, and to communicate the character's eccentricities and activities. [22] Chas, played by Stiller, appears in a red tracksuit, matching him with Ari and Uzi and suggesting "running away from sadness".

[31] Professor Claire Perkins added that in The Royal Tenenbaums, this tension regarding a possible remarriage has minor class and racial elements, with Chas refusing to call Henry by his first name and Royal calling Henry an "old black buck". [90] In 2014, The Huffington Post journalist Lisa Thomson evaluated it as one of Anderson's best films, and that finding laughs in divorce was a highlight. Enraged, Chas chases Eli through the house and wrestles him to the ground. [69] By February 2002, it doubled Rushmore's total gross at the U.S. box office. Margot, who was adopted, was awarded a grant for a play that she wrote in the ninth grade.

Hackman won a Golden Globe for his performance, and the screenwriters were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The filmmakers went to efforts to distinguish the film's backgrounds from a recognizable New York, with fashions and sets combining the appearances of different time periods. Salinger, it follows the lives of three gifted siblings who experience great success in youth, and even greater disappointment and failure in adulthood. [51] Mayshark wrote that literature shapes the narrative, which is presented as a book with chapters, a prologue and an epilogue. [24] Gene Wilder was also rumored to be a possible choice. Royal rescues Ari and Uzi, but the boys' dog, Buckley, is killed. [16] The children of the Glass family in Salinger's work are precocious with an abundance of exceptional talents.
