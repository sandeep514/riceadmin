Ntcham of course took the plaudits in Rome with the impudent chipped finish in injury time but Elyounousssi was the best player on the park that night. Yet the stand out performance came in September 2018 as Celtic and Ntcham controlled the game from start to finish, there were doubts creeping in however that such dominance may not be rewarded with the victory it deserved. Vasilis Barkas, Shane Duffy, Kristoffer Ajer, Jeremie Frimpong and Callum McGregor were all chosen by every Celtic fan who responded. Nir Bitton and Hatem Abd Elhamed have of course tested positive for the virus and we wish them a full and speedy recovery. The young Frenchman also impressed in the 3-2 win at Ibrox when the 10 men emerged victorious and broke the hearts of a confident Ibrox team. Yet Ntcham is one of the most naturally gifted players in Celtic’s squad and one with the vision, passing range and ability to run a game from central midfield, he can also be a goal threat. The reason for the lack of worry is surely the quality of player who can step into the gaps. If you believe the apparent leaked team ahead of today’s game Elyounoussi may start on the bench, if he does it’s a bit of a curveball from Neil Lennon. </p> <p>The Celtic Star is committed to bringing you the best coverage of Celtic, past, present and future. “It’s not ideal to be doing that in an empty stadium but it’s still giving him that chance to pull on the jersey and, hopefully, to put in a good performance as well.

(Scottish Sun), Celtic are set to challenge the Scottish Government over the strict coronavirus protocols which have forced Ryan Christie into self-isolation for 14 days, thereby missing the first Old Firm clash of the season, despite the player testing negative for Covid-19. </p> <p>Supporters, however, believe he's the man to fire Neil Lennon's side to glory at Celtic Park. You can build and share your starting XI below. </p> <p>It was Billy McNeill’s return to Celtic Park as manager and Celtic lost 5-1 to Arsenal . That’s probably why he gets a run of games but often finds himself dropping back out the team. </p> <p>Also missing is of course Ryan Christie – keep an eye on that one and whether Ex-Celt Kieran Tierney makes the Arsenal team against Manchester City tonight, if he does big questions need to be asked – and for a team already missing James Forrest and with doubts surrounding Albian Ajeti’s recovery from a hamstring injury, it may be that opportunity knocks for a couple of players with enough ability to impact on the big occasion and they’ve proven they can before. (Scottish Sun), Progressing quicker than anticipated, Hibs midfielder Joe Newell could be available for the club’s return to league action next weekend but, in the meantime, he will be joined on the sidelines by Jamie Murphy. </p> <p>June Sarpong recalls being left out of photoshoot with white colleagues and told ‘black girls don’t sell’, Dorian Electra: My Agenda review – frenetic, pummelling protest-pop, Kelly Brook's date night mini dress will leave you speechless, El Haj and Efih debut as Nachula rescues Zaragoza with first Reto Iberdrola goal against Osasuna, BoE's Bailey sees economic risks skewed 'very heavily' to downside, Google rolls out Shazam-killing feature with latest update, White noise as sleep aid may do more harm than good, say scientists, Tesla delivers extended range and improved cabin for Model 3, Hard hit by virus, airlines push for tests over quarantines, Watch Yotam Ottolenghi at Esquire Townhouse 2020. </p> <p>It will be just that depth which will be the difference over the course of the season. Here’s a reminder…. Celtic’s Covid-19 impacted squad will mean that the team will go into today’s match with theRangers without some regular starters. “It’s hard without the fans, there’s no question about that, but you’ve got to try to make the most of the situation. The likes of Scott Brown, Greg Taylor and James Forrest have attracted the ire of fans at stages this season, leaving Ferguson flummoxed. The other player with a habit of producing in big games then turning in an average performance against the lesser lights is Moi Elyounousssi. </p> <p>Olivier Ntcham’s quality has never been in question, yet there has always been a nagging doubt that the Frenchman doesn’t deliver on a regular basis, whether that perception is fair or not I’ve never been quite able to decide. </p> <p>The likes of Mohamed Elyounoussi, Greg Taylor and Leigh Griffiths, however, would have to settle for a place on the bench. The full lineup as chosen by the fans is: Vasilis Barkas, Diego Laxalt, Christopher Jullien, Shane Duffy, Kristoffer Ajer, Jeremie Frimpong, Scott Brown, Callum McGregor, Olivier Ntcham, Odsonne Edouard, Albian Ajeti. As quoted by The Scottish Daily Mail, Commons said: “They have bigger and better squads than every other club in the country, so the chance to utilise as many of those players as possible should highlight their strength in depth.It should be a blessing. Two goals and a man of the match performance saw Celtic into the league cup final and showed Moi, bereft of confidence when he joined on loan from Southampton, had the mentality to play for Celtic in the big games. Though if he had even 20 minutes in his legs it would be enough to strike fear into our opponents. </p> <p>His mere presence on the bench may be enough to plant the seeds of doubt today. But Celtic have shown before they do their talking on the park. His performance in the 5-0 win over theRangers at Celtic Park in April 2018 showed what he’s all about. </p> <p>When is the 2020 US election day and will it go forward as planned? Of course, that could be from the bench but either way Moi will have a part to play today and he has the ability to hurt our opponents. Odsonne Edouard is back following his own positive test while away with the French Under 21 squad and it would be a shock indeed if he even made even the bench this weekend. </p> <p>We have players missing today and it appears our opponents sense an opportunity and once again their loyal lapdogs are talking them up in the press. </p> <p>©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved. Keep an eye on the lad, these encounters suit the big game Bhoy. Expect both to answer. (Football Insider), Rangers legend Ally McCoist believes his former club should jump at the chance to sign former Arsenal and West Ham United midfielder Jack Wilshere, despite the player’s injury history. To have such a controlling impact against a Lazio side who pushed Juventus all the way in the Italian title race says it all. As a Bellshill Bhoy I was taken to my first Celtic game in the summer of 1987. It was finest gift anyone ever gave me when he walked me through Parhead's gates. We needn’t have worried as Ntcham added the icing on the cake to a brilliant counter attack and personal performance in the game with the winning goal. I thought I was a jinx, I think my Grandfather might have thought the same. Celtic vs Rangers player ratings as Connor Goldson double secures Old Firm victory for Steve Gerrard’s side. What isn’t in question is that Ntcham likes a big game and they don’t come much bigger than this. The closure of the transfer window saw a streamlined squad emerge but one with quality in depth. </p> <p>Similarities ahead of today’s game there I’m sure you’ll agree. His best two games in a Celtic shirt were probably the away game against Lazio in Rome and in the 5-2 League Cup semi-final win against Hibs.
