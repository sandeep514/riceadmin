</html>";s:4:"text";s:9307:"His performance in Villa's 4–1 win was described by Sky Sports as "his most influential" since joining the club. Undeservingly, in the final of Europe’s showpiece competition, Pirès’ Arsenal career would end in tragedy. His first campaign in north London, the 2000/01 season, ended in anguish as Arsenal failed to match Manchester United’s pace at the summit of the Premiership and allowed the FA Cup to slip through their grasp, surrendering a late lead in the tournament’s final to a Michael Owen brace. And then Lachor equalised, enabling Lens to be champions. In the recent ITV4 show Keane & Vieira: Best of Enemies, the two great midfielders attempted to agree on their era’s combined Arsenal-Manchester United dream team. Robert Pires; Pires in 2011. (Laughs) Yes a bit, because I left my little family club to join a big French club where I knew that every day would be difficult. At the time what I wanted was to be a professional footballer and to play in France. [47] In October 2010, it was reported that Conference National club Crawley Town intended to talk to Pires about joining them for some part of the season, but the player's spokesman said they were "not aware of any interest" from that club. Despite their domestic despair, Metz would still have memories of their Coupe de la Ligue triumph of two years earlier to hold dear; their first major trophy for a decade and Pirès’ maiden taste of glory. As the season progressed, though, Pires' form improved, outscoring his selection rivals overall despite a bizarre penalty incident with Thierry Henry against Manchester City when Pires, having scored from the spot earlier in the game, tried passing it to Arsenal's star striker but Henry missed the ball and it went down as a penalty miss. When Jens Lehmann’s early red card left his team without a goalkeeper, one player would naturally be forced to leave the field to be replaced by their reserve custodian Manuel Almunia. But the shifting nature of the English top-flight would not stop Pirès and his teammates from continuing to rewrite their club’s history in reaching their first Champions League final. But at the time I didn’t want to leave France. And I say “the whole of the left? But then the scenario – it was so hard, for the French, for the Italians. And they were saying “if we’re losing Overmars, who is going to come in?” And when they were told that it was Pirès who was coming, everyone said “Who? !” It was at Sunderland! “The worst thing was that we liked it down there [in Marseille],” Pirès’ then-wife Nathalie told ESPN in 2001, “but give us a choice today between the sun of the south of France and the rain of London and we will surely choose the rain.” France’s loss was to become England’s considerable gain. [14], By 2001–02, Pires had fully got to grips with the English game and had one of his best seasons. And everyone was a little disappointed that he left for Barcelona. Pirès attempted to play through his mounting hardships, dribble on through the mire, but growing pressure would eventually force him out of the city. Despite playing two months fewer than most of his fellow nominees, he scooped the FWA Footballer of the Year award. And then two players arrive who are, I think, in the same state as me. Such was his charm, enamouring not only the adoring fans that lined the stands but the professionals alongside whom he plied his trade, when a still-injured Pirès gingerly scaled the podium to lift his first Premier League trophy, his teammates dropped to their knees and bowed before him, in honour of his services to their achievement. [6], Pires is a graduate of the FC Metz youth academy, making his senior debut in 1993 against Lyon. When I saw my number on the fourth official’s board to be substituted, I couldn't believe it. And then Pat Vieira was flattened by a terrible tackle! He saw my game and how I played, and one day he came up to me and said, “Robert, I know you’re not left-footed but I want you to play on the left”. Breathless repetitions of “Super Robert Pirès” spilled out of Highbury and skipped through the streets of London. [38][39] Pires was instrumental in Arsenal's Quarter Final Champions League first leg against Juventus F.C., where Arsenal won 2–0. Back at the club he adored, he would not only walk the halls of his old stomping ground, refreshing his memory of the halcyon days, but would begin to learn from his old teacher all over again, this time beginning his coaching journey in the place he best learned to master his bewitching craft. I learnt a lot in terms of maturity, because it’s not easy there. Although it’s worse for us because we lost in the World Cup final. Pires made a sluggish start to the campaign, with just one goal to his name (against Everton) prior to October,[27] but a wonder-goal against Liverpool at Anfield kick-started his season. But, having come so close to winning the league with Metz, these near-misses at Marseille proved harrowing. Into it limped a player with obvious talents but one bearing bruises on both his shins and self-esteem. He was also voted by Arsenal fans as the 6th greatest player in the club's history. And while his comrades evidenced their unique appreciation for the winger with their grand gestures of obeisance, the Arsenal fans sang theirs. He also blamed it for his odd behavior, such as publicly fighting with French coach Raymond Domenech in early 2004. Because there was so much pressure and tension surrounding the match. Well what is weird is that I had no emotion. He opened the scoring for his team to defeat league leaders Barcelona 2–0, avenging his premature departure against Barcelona in the Champions League Final the previous May. READ PART III – Robert talks about the controversial end to his international career, his thoughts on the current Arsenal and France teams, his opinions on Ligue 1 and his post-professional career. [60][61] On 2 September 2014, he was signed by Goa, becoming their marquee signing. Throughout the 2001/02 season, as Arsenal romped to a league and cup double, the Gunners’ very own d’Artagnan proved insatiable. Against Aston Villa, Pires chased after a long ball by Freddie Ljungberg, and lobbed the ball over the pursuing George Boateng, and finished off the move with a delightful lob over Peter Schmeichel. I was a little disappointed. It’s terrible, what happened that evening to the Italians, it’s unimaginable, it’s impossible. Pires successfully tackled Patrick Vieira and fed the ball to Thierry Henry who passed to Fàbregas to score Arsenal's first goal, the first time that Pires had gotten the better of Vieira. Read  |  Freddie Ljungberg: the Arsenal diaries. [citation needed], The 2007–08 season was marked by the ongoing saga between Juan Román Riquelme and the board of Villarreal. Well it’s a club which meant a lot and still means a lot to me today, because if I was lucky enough to have a great career, it’s because Metz showed enormous confidence in me, especially the club president Carlo Molinari, because it was he who gave me my first professional contract when I was 19. One language Pirès had no trouble mastering, however, was the one he’d speak with his feet – intimate conversations conducted between boots and balls – and so it was on the pitch he first learned to express himself. Though Real Madrid and Juventus both made eyes at the Frenchman, the prospect of learning under the tutelage of Le Professeur, alongside a healthy contingent of his fellow countrymen at Arsenal, saw him set sail for north London. your first goal for France, against Turkey, I was the one who passed to David Trezeguet, « French moneybags in the hunt for last-minute marquee signings, Interview: France legend Robert Pires – The Arsenal Years », Pires keen for Arsenal to come through ‘nightmare’ | Arsenal Nieuws, Arsenal Need To Send Liverpool’s Season Down The Tubes | Arsenal Network, Our favourite things online this week: from Robert Pirès to hockey fights | goalpost360: Nigeria Football / Soccer, Highlights, Scores, Our favourite things online this week: from Robert Pirès to hockey fights - Avidmav, Our favourite things online this week: from Robert Pirès to hockey fights - Sports Network 247, Our favourite things online this week: from Robert Pirès to hockey fights | NHL Set, Interview: Arsenal legend Robert Pires – The International Years, Pires keen for Arsenal to come through ‘nightmare’ | Arseblog News – the Arsenal news site, Coupe de France 4th Round – Wet, Wild and Windy Winners, FFW Pod – Brassier to Brest, and other stories…. And that’s why, this week, I watched Metz-Creteil on TV. [4][69], Pires was part of France's 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 winning squads, but had to miss the 2002 World Cup due to an injury he sustained playing for Arsenal. He was the first person who played me on the left wing. Villarreal were defeated 4–1 on aggregate, but Pires received a warm return from the Arsenal supporters, who sang his name throughout both legs. Then you were on the bench, wondering if you’d play. So yes, my relationship with all the players was good, honestly. But we saw the Italians and they were destroyed.
