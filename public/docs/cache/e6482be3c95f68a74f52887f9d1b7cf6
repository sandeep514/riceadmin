But, it does take time to learn because there is a ton of material and practice needed. Not sure I agree with what was suggested for picking a strike price in the Beginners Option course, but totally loved the TTG Triangle course, and thought it was very well done and explained, with lots of examples.

Let us know if there is anything we can do to help you further. I’ll let you know folks - Suge likely has other ideas! Please let us know if there's anything we can improve.
