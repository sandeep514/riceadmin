Â­Everywhere else, in my experience, changing conditions tend to demand color changes. But those brains are better at decision making than any computer on earth. @outdoorsfirst The color of a background object is determined, in part, by its own natural color as affected by the color of the water and by color shifts caused by intervening distances. Sign In In his book, Trout Biology, biologist W. B. Willers relates how rainbow trout situated in a stream setting were offered various colored salmon eggs against various colored backgrounds. A good way to start is to think of two primary factors: Dr. Colin Kageyama, in his book What Fish See (which is primarily concerned with what steelhead and trout can see), provides a somewhat different take and seems to suggest that what fish see best is always the best choice. Trying to predict what colors they see at any given moment becomes extremely problematic. With bait and many types of lures, the color a steelhead can see best is not always the best choice. Quick warns: "Which objects reflect infrared is unknown. But fluorescent colors can work under the same conditions. We also don't know which baits may have infrared coloring, because humans can't see it. Herzog and I agree about toning down both the aggression and color of any presentation when the water clears, with this disclaimer: When all else fails, try the bright color. In his book, Color Guide to Steelhead Drift Fishing, Bill Herzog writes more about matching the size and aggressiveness of the bait to water levels and water clarity than about pure color selection. Additionally, dark colored beads show up better in these conditions than light beads. What species of salmon are you fishing behind? How can they be conditioned to a color that was hot last year? Trout often feed at the surface, so perhaps they're able to use their ultraviolet vision to identify insects," which would be important for steelhead fry, parr, and smolts, and less important, it would seem, for adults.

Much has been written about the color-selection process for steelhead. This is good advice, but falls somewhat short of being great advice. (For these fine resource books by Herzog and Kageyama, contact Amato Publications at 800/541-9498. It is buoyant and enhanced with garlic and salt.

Submit a Press Release They make choices every time you swing something past them, and sometimes their decisions are based on emotive responses. That went on for weeks. Conversely, if the water is low and clear, you will want to bump down a size. Don't get lost in it. A fluorescent color is one that gives off a wavelength longer than the one it receives, and it tends to appear as that color from longer distances underwater, and may begin to elicit a response from a longer distance. So, which color looks most "natural" to a steelhead depends on the background color it's being viewed against. While the overall equipment is the same, color reception varies." Beads that match the more mature eggs are often referred to as âmilkyâ or âturning.â Sometimes the egg will deteriorated to the point of being opaque, those are considered âdead eggs.â. Stay natural. Steelhead will eat almost any color bead some of the time. Then we arrive at the morass of available light, which gradually decreases from noon to sunset. "Even great science can't replace on-the-river experience for an angler," Herzog says. Sockeye Salmon (Reds) have the smallest and reddest eggs of all the salmon. The best spinner fishermen I know use relatively huge #6 silver-plate blades in winter to, as they put it, "wake fish up" when the water is colder than 35Â°F and force some kind of emotive response.
