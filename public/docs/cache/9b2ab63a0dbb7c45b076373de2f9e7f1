But those brains are better at decision making than any computer on earth. @outdoorsfirst The color of a background object is determined, in part, by its own natural color as affected by the color of the water and by color shifts caused by intervening distances. Sign In In his book, Trout Biology, biologist W. B. Willers relates how rainbow trout situated in a stream setting were offered various colored salmon eggs against various colored backgrounds. A good way to start is to think of two primary factors: Dr. Colin Kageyama, in his book What Fish See (which is primarily concerned with what steelhead and trout can see), provides a somewhat different take and seems to suggest that what fish see best is always the best choice. Trying to predict what colors they see at any given moment becomes extremely problematic. With bait and many types of lures, the color a steelhead can see best is not always the best choice. Quick warns: "Which objects reflect infrared is unknown. But fluorescent colors can work under the same conditions. We also don't know which baits may have infrared coloring, because humans can't see it. Herzog and I agree about toning down both the aggression and color of any presentation when the water clears, with this disclaimer: When all else fails, try the bright color. In his book, Color Guide to Steelhead Drift Fishing, Bill Herzog writes more about matching the size and aggressiveness of the bait to water levels and water clarity than about pure color selection. Additionally, dark colored beads show up better in these conditions than light beads. What species of salmon are you fishing behind? How can they be conditioned to a color that was hot last year? Trout often feed at the surface, so perhaps they're able to use their ultraviolet vision to identify insects," which would be important for steelhead fry, parr, and smolts, and less important, it would seem, for adults. How deep can they get? However, if you are fishing the late stages of a salmon spawn, you will want more washed out dead egg colors. Saturday & Sunday Closed.

Instructions say to place a lure or bait you intend to use on a bright background on a bright day or a dark background on a cloudy day, and use a filter that matches water color (blue for clear water, green for green water and brown for muddy water), to eventually ­determine "which lures are the brightest and most visible? The point at which this happens comes earlier in cloudy water. Great Lakes Steelhead Beads (GLS Beads) Brilliant, Creamsicle, Hot Sauce, Super UV Orange and Scrambled Persimmon. OFM Partners A fisherman doesn't have time to analyze the water for sediment, meter the light coming from the sky, or make a relative water-clarity analysis. I've caught many steelhead multiple times on the same color. All of a sudden clouds roll in and the fish stop biting, you should try switching to a lighter colored bead such as Natural Roe or Tangerine. If something is red, it reflects light from the red portion of the spectrum and absorbs the rest. So the color of the thing as it slowly approaches within a foot or two in the low, cold flows of winter remains fairly true. The set […], Once you have your bead leader assembled, it's time to hit the water. Mottled TroutBeads Natural Roe, Tangerine, Mandarin Roe, Peach Roe  and Orange Clear. Made of natural stone, these beads are heavy, fast sinking and deadly effective for catching fish. This is due to "color shift" caused by the intervening molecules of water and particulates that filter light at a distance. My system for dealing with color hasn't changed much in 30 years. Much has been written about the color-selection process for steelhead. This is good advice, but falls somewhat short of being great advice. (For these fine resource books by Herzog and Kageyama, contact Amato Publications at 800/541-9498. It is buoyant and enhanced with garlic and salt. Due to increased light penetration in the water, a wider variance of colors will work most efficiently." As this article hits the newsstands, streams will be in the grip of winter.

So many variables exist that no other system can simplify it as well for me. Silver-sided baitfish look copperish or bronze in stained water. "When steelhead rivers have that 'dialed in' green look that every angler drools over," Herzog continues, " visibility will be 2 1/2 to 4 feet. Where a human sees blaze orange, a deer—in theory—sees some dull shade of bronze, because color reception differs. Submit a Press Release They make choices every time you swing something past them, and sometimes their decisions are based on emotive responses. That went on for weeks. Conversely, if the water is low and clear, you will want to bump down a size. Don't get lost in it. A fluorescent color is one that gives off a wavelength longer than the one it receives, and it tends to appear as that color from longer distances underwater, and may begin to elicit a response from a longer distance. So, which color looks most "natural" to a steelhead depends on the background color it's being viewed against. While the overall equipment is the same, color reception varies." Beads that match the more mature eggs are often referred to as “milky” or “turning.” Sometimes the egg will deteriorated to the point of being opaque, those are considered “dead eggs.”. Stay natural. Steelhead will eat almost any color bead some of the time. Then we arrive at the morass of available light, which gradually decreases from noon to sunset. "Even great science can't replace on-the-river experience for an angler," Herzog says. Sockeye Salmon (Reds) have the smallest and reddest eggs of all the salmon. The best spinner fishermen I know use relatively huge #6 silver-plate blades in winter to, as they put it, "wake fish up" when the water is colder than 35°F and force some kind of emotive response.
