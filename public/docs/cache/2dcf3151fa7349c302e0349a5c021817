I had just gotten out of my sleeping bag one dark night, took two steps, and a burp gun cut loose and sent about 20 rounds into my bag. Was Chosin Reservoir a defeat for American troops? Bergee: The helmet of one of my men was spun around on his head as a bullet passed in and out through the side. That is how it was at Chosin. North Korea,Â 27 November 1950: Yudam-ni, at the western extremity of the Chosin Reservoir, was the scene of early combat in the campaign, as Chinese forces attacked the two Marine regiments there. Some people tell me it would be wise to try and forget those times. Many articles have been written about the Chosin fight by writers who were not there, but let me tell you, as one who was there, we were a band of brothersâand we were coming out of that trap like Marines, or we werenât coming out at all! These were broken up by naval gunfire support from Task Force 90. When we came to a roadblock, we had to attempt to climb around the Chinese firing positions, which were holding back our advance. The wind hit your face until it was raw, and the driving snow whipped into your eyes and half-blinded you as you searched for enemy activity. Soldiers of the United States Marines searching for snipers in the Chosin Reservoir. 27 Novemberâ 24 December 1950 . I have come to believe that I have an obligation to the future, to give young people the chance to have a meaningful understanding of the past and the glory that was, though only in retrospect. It seems possible to me, since I saw the bodies of Chinese soldiers stacked like cordwood at daybreak after that battle. Childe Hassam, American impressionist painter and illustrator. Whited occupied a roadblock with his anti-tank unit between Hagaru-ri and Yudam-ni, the farthest western concentration of Marines in the valley. The company was being raked with automatic-weapons fire. One bright light above them inspired one of Whiteâs friends to later write a country song about the âStar of Kotoâri.â Whited remembers, âThat was it, our ray of hope. We moved through infinite darkness in ghostly clouds of snow over an icy road that led to the bottom of the mountain and safety. âEmily J. Lambert, intern with NHHC Communication and Outreach Division, November 2019. I donât want the younger generation to forget what their fathers and grandfathers went through in North Korea. MH: What acts did you witness that you regarded as outstandingly heroic? And can you believe, with the snow came lightning? Bergee: I could fill up your notebook with experiences. Hastily mobilized from Manchuria for deployment in Korea, they lacked any winter clothing or sufficient food. My parka was dirty and blood-stained. Weather and topographical conditions around the reservoir made further decisive offensive action by the UN forces improbable. In many situations, naval close air support, prioritized by COMNAVFE to support the Chosin operations, inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese and was key in maintaining the retreatâs momentum. I never knew if I would be one of the survivors, but I knew the Chinese could not contain the 1st Marine Division. Chosin Reservoir is a man-made lake located in the northeast of the Korean peninsula. Neither White nor Whited recalls much concern over the fact that their liberation of South Korea had escalated into a war against Communist China. The 1st Marine Division reached Hungnam on 11 December, and evacuation by Task Force 90 ships commenced. Abruptly forced into the defensive by the Chinese onslaught, they now had to fight their way southeastward through the enemy encirclement and stage a fighting retreat along their single MSR to the Wonsan and Hungnam port areas, from where they were to be evacuated by the U.S. Those men were interred at Chosin because the space was needed on the vehicles for badly wounded. They would overrun various positions, and we had to fight them man to man. HISTORY reviews and updates its content regularly to ensure it is complete and accurate. After the successful Inchon landings in August 1950, just two months prior to the confrontation with Chinese forces at the Chosin Reservoir, it appeared that the still-young conflict would end in victory for United Nations (UN) forces. MH: Do the memories of that campaign haunt you at any time? With similarly faulty information, Chinese military leadership made crucial mistakes that cost troopsâ lives and gave U.S. forces time to retreat. The Battle of Chosin is illustrative of the shifting tide of the Korean War in the wake of the Chinese Communist infiltration and, then, outright invasion across the Yalu River into North Korea. In a place where it was too frigid to dig foxholes without explosives and bulldozers, combatants piled frozen bodies in lieu of sandbags. Bergee: I recall seeing one Marine sitting behind the wheel of a jeep, a bullet through his forehead. By the time White returned to his unit in early December, a lot had changed on the front lines. Field, James A., and Ernest M. Eller. It wasnât easy, and hundreds of men were constipated throughout the campaign. I yelled back: âIf you run out of ammo, throw snowballs at the SOBsâbut be sure and put a damn rock inside them!â. On December 6, Chinese forces blew up a crucial bridge over a treacherous mountain gorge, cutting off the evacuation route. Altogether, between 20,000 and 25,000 U.N. troops were involved in the Chosin Reservoir battle. When the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950, he expressed concern over his naval forces being inadequate for the challenges posed by operations around the Korean peninsula. MH: It was certainly a grim business, wasnât it? I also remember a young Marine who had been hit in the face with shrapnel. Homepage for MCRL Battle Studies, Country Studies, & Staff Rides guides for EWS, CSC, SAW, and MCWAR. It turned out they came right through the middle of our position.â. The 1st Marine Division also reported 7,338 non-battle casualties due to the cold weather, adding up to a total of 17,833 casualties. However most of the commanders of the U.S. Army divisions and regiments had no such experience. It is important, not to me, but to the future. A day like all of the other days. Feet froze into blocks of ice inside boots. Images courtesy of Robert Whited and Jean White. However, while MacArthur was extolling his commandâs successes, the Chinese Communists, in power in China for less than a year, saw their new regime increasingly threatened by the UN forcesâ advances northward and felt compelled to intervene in the conflict. Chapter IV covers The Battle of the Changjin Reservoir. Blair, Clay. Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, campaign early in the Korean War, part of the Chinese Second Offensive (NovemberâDecember 1950) to drive the United Nations out of North Korea. The Korean War began in June 1950, when communist-backed troops from the north of the recently divided nation stormed into the Western-aligned south. There was no such thing as ârear echelonâ troops at Chosin. The 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division of the US Army successfully used the characteristics of the offense during the breakout operation from Ydam-ni to relieve Fox Company, 2d Battalion, 7th Marines on Dec 1-3, 1950. by Billy C. Mossman, U.S. Army Center of Military History, Washington D.C. 1988. The 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division of the US Army successfully used the characteristics of the offense during the breakout operation from Ydam-ni to relieve Fox Company, 2d Battalion, 7th Marines on Dec 1-3, 1950. These actions were not looked upon favorably by his immediate superior, the commander of X Corps, Major General Edward M. Almond. His plan? And victory, seemingly in reach, evaporated, leaving the war to slog on for several more years. That was a time when the Marine Corps was once again put to the test. Bergee: Yes, I do. 22 Issue 2: 257-274. A bugler blows a song as tribute amidst a row of white crosses marking the graves of the lives lost at the Chosin Reservoir while soldiers from the First Marine Division pay their respects. In the words of Commanding General Oliver P. Smith: âRetreat, hell. The machine-gun crew only fired off a few bursts before the enemy fire was trained on the exposed gun. The Chinese forces involved in the battle were the 9th Army Group, which was commanded by General Song Shi-Lun. Progress was so slow, and we had such a long way to go. MH: Itâs hard to imagine fighting in that cold. Once they were shut off, they might not start again. It looks like you're using Internet Explorer 11 or older. I vividly remember the time a Chinese soldier hit me with his fist right in my frozen nose. Meanwhile, ROK I Corps, ROK Marines, and the U.S. 3rd and 7th Infantry Divisions established a defensive perimeter around the port area, fighting off Chinese probing attacks. Inside the perimeter at Hagaru-ri, the Marines prepared for the anticipated night attack. Instead, about two weeks later, the two veterans enjoyed Christmas in Pusanâwith a hot turkey dinner. Corsairs to Panthers: U.S. Marine Aviation in Korea. The article discusses the Chosin Reservoir campaign in December 1950 during the Korean War, particularly the fighting for Hill 1304 in the Koto-ri area. (Nonetheless, naval aviation from the West Coast Task Force in the Yellow Sea, which included smaller British and Australian carriers, continued to support Eighth Army operations.) You dreamed of being close to a roaring fire. The realization that you were so close to the enemy charged you with new energy and cleared your mind. Even the youngsters looked like old men with the layer of frost that was covering their faces. If the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, and the Army 3rd Division, who were down below in the valley, could not break through to us, then we would break out to them. As the 8th Army retreats, the Marines dig in at Chosin Reservoir and are quickly cut off and surrounded. Naval History. His 1987 book, Guest of the Emperor, is the story of former prisoner ofwar Corporal Frank O. Promnitz, U.S. Marine Corps, who survived the horrors of Bataan, Corregidor, the Death March, the prisoner-of-war camps and the Japanese âhell ships.â The latter book was selected for the Bataan Memorial Museum library in Santa Fe, N.M. Moreover, it would later be the path that X Corps would be forced to take in order to evacuate over 50 miles southeast toward the port of Hungnam. Two years later Whited, at 18, he joined the Corps, which deployed him to the Marine Brigade in Guam after training in San Diego. He was awarded the Navy Cross for that act of heroism. I was only 16, but big enough,â says Whited, who was working as a chaser in a bull ring in Wyoming when he made his first attempt. Selection of downloadable PDF maps depicting the movements and activities of the UN, the North Korean Army, and the Communist Chinese forces. It lay astride the road over a deep ravine. Despite the actions of the post-World War II political economizers, the Marine Corps proved, as it would time and time again, that it was truly a force in readiness-able to rapidly respond to America's defense needs in an increasingly complex and fluid world.
