This is ridiculously high and will almost certainly see some positive regression as the season goes on. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. "They're going to score. The Rockets are currently 29th in the NBA when it comes to defending in transition. They are bound to improve slightly just by the reversal of their luck when it comes to the amount of shots their opponents have made. Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email. "I laugh at all the memes and the stuff everybody comes up with," said Tucker, who was a game-best plus-19 in 36 minutes despite scoring only six points. The team’s starting lineup has been far and away their best defensive lineup, with a 101.4 defensive rating (61st percentile.) But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Tucker didn’t notice the wrap either and had no chance of getting there on time once Clemons finally verbalized the issue, resulting in yet another open three. Look at this play and try to figure out what exactly went wrong: The play resulted in Harden and Clint Capela looking so lost that it’s difficult to see what even caused such a gaff. But if no one kept track of who was taking shots and making buckets, we’d have, at best, an extremely fuzzy impression of which players were actually any good, even if we had access to all their other statistics. For example, if a player faced 100 2-point shots and allowed 46 of them to go in when you’d expect 56 percent of them to be converted if wide open, that player prevented …, … about 20 points from being scored with his defense. This allows us to calculate an initial score that we call RAW_DRAYMOND. At this rate, the team needs to either seriously lock in and actually pay attention on defense so these easy buckets don’t come left and right, or simplify things for their perimeter defenders and do less switching. I’ve highlighted mistakes that have been made from just about every notable Rocket thus far, besides Russell Westbrook. But when there are these constant lapses in communication and awareness such as you see from Capela and Gordon in these plays, there’s simply no way to execute this scheme well. But the way he’s played recently isn’t an ingredient for success, especially when combined with the other lackluster performances on that end from guys like Eric Gordon and James Harden. Basketball, in some sense, is fundamentally a shooting game. Through seven games, the Rockets have vastly underperformed on the defensive end. This is fine, if done well. He’s not. NBA players by DRAYMOND* defensive ratings, based on opponents’ shooting data in the regular season and playoffs, with a minimum of 2,000 possessions played in 2018-19. The Jazz’s Derrick Favors was the top defender, followed by the Knicks’ Mitchell Robinson, while the Cavaliers’ Collin Sexton was the worst defender in the league. Now here’s another: Here, Austin Rivers calls for a switch as he sees Eric Gordon’s man run towards him, assuming he is going to set some kind of screen. It’s not just this lack of awareness that Westbrook shows that has hurt the defense. It’s hard to say which is correct since we don’t know exactly how Mike D’Antoni coaches his team to defend this look, but one of these two scenarios is definitely correct— and it doesn’t particularly matter which. But believe it or not, this had long been the situation when it came to measuring player defense. For a team that considers themselves to be among the league’s elite that will be contending for a championship come playoff time, their current level of play on the defensive side of the ball is the furthest thing from acceptable. While this does happen, it seems like Harden expected P.J. Just as CARMELO is a goofy backronym (Career-Arc Regression Model Estimator with Local Optimization) that honors one of our favorite players, Carmelo Anthony, we decided to give our new defensive rating a player-centric name, this time in honor of the Golden State Warriors’ Draymond Green, who has long been one of the best players in basketball by opponent shooting. Perhaps Tucker did see the off-ball screen and assumed Harden would fight over it since it was Tucker’s responsibility to rotate on the drive, and Harden simply fell asleep. All right, so the acronym may or may not catch on. So today we’re going to use this game against Miami as a launching point to go over what exactly has gone wrong for the Rockets’ defense so far and what they can do to remedy these issues before it’s too late. By contrast, Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook — whom DRAYMOND regards as being vastly overrated by other defensive metrics — was the nearest defender on only 12 shots per 100 possessions. Let’s conclude with a list of players who are most affected, positively or negatively, by the incorporation of DRAYMOND. That is, until a few years ago, when the NBA started publishing data on opponents’ shooting. In fact, it’s been the opposite. According to ESPN Stats & Information data, Davis was 0-of-1 from the field and committed two turnovers in 26 possessions in which Tucker was the primary defender on him. His defensive play has been so damaging, especially against the Heat, that he deserves his own section. started publishing data on opponents’ shooting, number of possessions that the player was on the floor, traditionally used to make its projections. They’ve also allowed opponents to take 16 wide-open threes per game (the closest defender being more than six feet away) and a blistering 49.1% of those shots have found the bottom of the hoop. Therefore, DRAYMOND is picking up information that isn’t well-measured by either RPM or BPM. Russell Westbrook led the Rockets' team meeting after their 117-107 loss to the Blazers on Wednesday, and the former MVP continued to discuss Houston's defensive ... (No. The Rockets' defensive game plan against the Lakers relies heavily on Gordon and 6-foot-5 center P.J. NBA players by DRAYMOND* defensive ratings, based on opponents’ shooting data in the regular season and playoffs, with a minimum of 10,000 possessions played since 2013-14, * Defensive Rating Accounting for Yielding Minimal Openness by Nearest Defender. ", Rockets defense gives no quarter against Lakers, Everything you need to know about the NBA GOAT debate, Saints, Pels owner Benson victim of car thieves, Sources: Lue agrees to 5-year deal to coach Clips, Morey: 'Right time' to step down as Rockets GM, Sources: NBA, union extend negotiations on CBA, Likely NBA top pick LaMelo Ball signs with Puma, Stan Van Gundy meets with Pelicans, sources say, Lowe: How Daryl Morey challenged NBA norms and almost won it all. Those guys are two of the best players of our generation. Russell Westbrook has been a disaster. It appears that Harden, who was currently defending the center, slid over to help on the drive, as he should. What the hell does that mean? Here, Chris Clemons loses track of his man as he wraps around the arch, and at the last second notices and tells Tucker to switch. In the long run, RAPM is basically6 the “right” way to measure player value, since it can account for all the direct and indirect contributions a player makes that may or may not have a corresponding statistic attached to them. With Westbrook on the bench, that number goes down to 108.1 points per 100 possessions (46th percentile.). Links To Other Sites Only Mildly Annoying, Rockets, NBA react to death of scout BJ Johnson. It’s highly unlikely they become the most unlucky defense of all time, but they also need to get better at not allowing so many wide-open three-point attempts. Players like Eric Gordon and James Harden have no excuse for the level of focus they’ve shown off ball.
