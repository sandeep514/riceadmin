Very pleased with my purchase and a great survive had notifications when it on its way and when it had been recovered by the next carrier will happily use again. I was contacted by UPS. © 2020 Trustpilot, Inc. All rights reserved. I wish I'd read all of these one star reviews before ordering from Paul Valentine. SO NOW ITS BEEN 8 BUSINESS DAY AND STILL HAVENT RECEIVED MY ORDER, WHICH I NEED BEFORE MONDAY. I ordered a watch and it came to my house in 6 days! Great watch! 1 month ago I returned a bracelet and they still have not given me my money back. Once again on time with delivery and outstanding purchase my wife loved it.Thanking youDerroll, Only the latest review will count in the company's TrustScore. I don't know people commented here and mentioned they have the best customer service who they are. I tried it on after a few weeks (as I didn't exactly have anywhere nice to wear it). The item I purchased was as expected.It was sent out quickly by the company too. Lovely product, wanted a watch for a while and it Didnt disappoint when it came. I love the watch and I'm very happy! I purchased an expensive necklace for my best friend's 30th birthday and 5 days later I have still not received my order despite calling and emailing them every day.Whilst I have managed to get hold of them (calling is best), it seems they are more concerned with sorting their internal delivery issue out than sending me what I have paid money for. Voice your opinion today and hear what 3080 customers have already said. Powerfully designed to modernise your everyday look and most importantly, they will help you stay summer safe with our UV400 lenses – completely designed for your comfort and protection. Very nicely presented and packaged.My only reservation is that the voucher arrived nearly a week late, but at least it arrived in time for my sister's birthday. However, customer service is not great. Ordered off this company twice & recieved fast efficient delivery & was very pleased with my purchases on both occasions. I am still waiting for my delivery 'it will be sorted soon once we figure out what went wrong' i.e. Do you agree with Paul Valentine's TrustScore? Very quick and easy service and very happy with the product. However, customer service is not great. Great price! You make urgent enquires to get one automated email and thats it, the responses from others on trust pilot I genuinely believe but PV reply to those is box standard, paypal are useless and act as middle men to retailers that are not so good, shame really as the jewellery looks fantastic and gorgeous pieces, having no contact from PV puts you right off and you automatically think FRAUD or SCAM, if PV warehouse has problems with thieves they need to sort it or if UPS are doing this then its serious, i paid for a watch what i got was an empty damaged box torn open and only a gift bag ! Really good quality and looks lovely on. And the delivery was a joke I paid extra still didn’t come on time. © 2020 Trustpilot, Inc. All rights reserved. Paul Valentine is same company as Faye they had to change name as they are getting bad press. Saw this product online and it was really well presented and looked amazing, thought I’d order it for my mrs. 3.7. uk.paul-valen tine.com. Why I saying FINALLY ? If there was 0 stars they would get that. Myself and my Husband … Absolutely fantastic service! Very pleased with my purchase! A return was agreed, labels printed and the carrier tracking says it has been delivered. © 2020 Trustpilot A/S. Write a review Write a review Reviews 4,357 Write a review. We bought this watch for my step daughters birthday and she loved it. Great service. Watch was delivered within 3 days. Paul valentine watches has collected 50 reviews with an average score of 2.12. Visit this website uk.paul-valen tine.com. I decided to email again asking about what is happening with my refund and this time I have been totally ignored!Edit: I have now received my refund after chasing it for weeks. Beautiful watch  gave a gift to my sister and she loved it! So disappointed with Paul Valentine. I was contacted by UPS. I wish I'd read all of these one star reviews before ordering from Paul Valentine. Thank you. Lovely website, products and excellent service and process. Not happy because I've been wanting to return an item for a week. Will definitely be ordering from you again! Really bad service , they don’t know what they are doing , late delivery . You are never going to succeed as a 'luxury jewellery brand' if you can't get basic customer service right. All rights reserved. making me wait on a time sensitive gift because something went wrong on their end. Unacceptable. I received a message later that night from UPS to say delivery had failed as there was nobody at the property. Word of advice: you should always put the customer first. I had a couple of queries about my order but it took 8 days to get a reply so my order was delivered before i even got a reply. Fast delivery and amazing quality product! Write a review. My review is solely based on my experience as a customer and I feel that if a company cannot provide the appropriate care for their customers then people should know. very good quality, I am very pleased with the order, I will order more! I definitely recommend the iconia collection. Waited almost 9 months for the product… Waited almost 9 months for the product I wanted to come back into stock, as soon a I received the back in stock notification I ordered it and was advised 2-4 delivery days The item I purchased was as expected.It was sent out quickly by the company too. Worldwide shipping High quality Sadly the bracelet was then out of stock. Very confusing and not good enough instructions!!
