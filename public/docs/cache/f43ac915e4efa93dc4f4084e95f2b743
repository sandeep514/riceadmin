Jorge Linares was a TV darling and two-weight world champion who was coming off the back of seven straight world title fight wins when Lomachenko faced the Japan-based Venezualen in May 2018 at Madison Square Garden for the WBA lightweight title, in an attempt to become a three-weight world champion. Using unorthodox training methods, Anatoly helped shape Vasyl into the elite, versatile fighter he is today. But if it appeared that Lopez was heading toward a shutout, Lomachenko finally began to open up and show his trademark combination punching. 													Vasiliy Lomachenko fields questions during a press conference ahead of his world lightweight championship fight against Anthony Crolla. After losing the first seven rounds on all three judges’ scorecards, Loma could not overcome that deficit despite his thrilling second-half performance. Especially if Crolla can pull off the upset, the second fight would be an even bigger affair and would make for an elite PPV draw. Given Lomachenko’s background, it makes sense that he would get an immediate rematch, especially with an upset of this caliber. As it turned out, Lomachenko was no match for the smaller Rigondeaux, who was frustrated to the point of quitting on his stool at the end of the sixth round. While Lopez was determined to be the boss and stalk his shorter opponent, Lomachenko focused on defense and lateral movement as he attempted to get a read on Lopez’s rhythm.

The former champion would later say that he “couldn’t see” Lomachenko’s hands that led to the knockout blows, a chilling indictment of the precision of Lomachenko, who captured his second title in two weight classes. However, should Lomachenko lose, the gates would open up in terms of who to go after next. Linares’ hand speed was considered just about as fast as Lomachenko’s and his flashy combinations caused the Ukranian problems throughout the fight. Although he is nearly an inch and a half shorter than the average lightweight fighter, he uses a combination of excellent footwork and exceptional hand speed to control distance and inflict heavy damage. Having already won featherweight gold at the 2008 Games, Loma flew to Britain to compete in the lightweight division. Rigondeaux was also a two-time Olympic gold medalist, coming from the famed Cuban school of boxing, and was making the step up two weight divisions from having reigned as lineal and unified super bantamweight champion, outclassing each of his previous opponents.
