Theses classics cartoons appeared on the Cartoon Network owned by Time Warner. Bugs Bunny is celebrating his milestone 80th birthday on Monday, and Warner Bros. is aiming to throw a celebration like no other. This was the golden age of American animation.

Rating System of Video Games: What is this? I hope anyone who reads this post will enjoy it as much as I did the research. Bugs Bunny Turns 80 as Warner Bros. Mel Blanc has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6835 Hollywood Boulevard. It is so sad we can’t do this with our kids today. You are exactly right about spending too much time in front of a TV. Looney Tunes to this day had characters, that you just never forgot. My parents’ only rule was to be home before dark. Lol… this is really amazing reading this article. He has a great attitude and sassy mouth. I am going to look at video games related to the Looney Tunes cartoons. I guess purchasing a Gamecube could work, but the games themselves are difficult to come by. Some of my favorite memories as a kid were getting up on a Saturday morning and watching Looney Tunes. I had a lot of fun putting it together. Later, Looney Tunes introduced the cartoon stars that we most associate with Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies today: At the start, Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies were based on the Warner Bros musical library. Due to Bugs' popularity during the golden age of American animation, he became an American cultural icon and the official mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment.

Thanks for stopping by, Ekene. It has a lot of educational things. Also, let me quote our favorite wabbit, Bugs Bunny. Wow, this was a very enlightening post. So the guardian should be aware of it. I really think I enjoy the cartoons better than the video games. It is funful and thrilling as well every one both young and adult always derive pleasure from watching it. He richly deserves the title, “The Man with a Thousand Voices.”. I appreciate your comments. However, for young gamers like us who are more into the digital age of gaming, this is really enlightening to know what gaming was like. I have added a link to your question about other voice actors. For me, they are part of my youth and my life now. Bugs Bunny’s career started with “A Wild Hare” which also began in the 1940s. That is a good idea about getting older folks interested in playing video games. I have done a post called https://gamingwithgrandpa.com/video-games-for-older-adults-the-following-chart-reflects-the. This is rather an interesting one to see here and thanks so much for sharing this piece here. I have done a post about the educational benefits of video games, https://gamingwithgrandpa.com/educational-benefits-of-video-games. I had a lot of fun doing it. I love it. I was hoping this post would touch the hearts of people who remember fond memories of their childhood. I somehow suddenly don’t feel so bad anymore since I am an absolute looney toon freak. I’ve been watching Looney Tunes from my childhood, and didn’t know all those details about them. Well! I’ve been a Looney Tunes fan since as far back as my earliest childhood memories. The first cartoon Mel worked on was “Picador Porky” (1937), as the voice of a drunken bull. I am a great Dan of cartoons ( till forever!) Tweety Bird, Sylvester, Speedy Gonzales, Yosemite Sam, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, and yes, the Tasmanian Devil were so much fun to watch. I want this post to be fun and entertaining.

I was hoping this post would make people think about the memories of their childhood. This has all the dressings and fillings any person needs to fill up their nostalgia tank. It is hard to believe he was the voice of all the characters of Looney Tunes. His battles with Barnyard Dawg and Henry, the chicken hawk were classics. For example, I have trouble saying, “Yellow”. I’m glad my post brought back good childhood memories. I am glad you liked my post. If you like this one, I think you would enjoy some of my other posts. Bugs was never the same. Mark, have an awesome day and try to check out some of my other posts about video games. Thank you so much for stopping by and commenting on my post. Warner Bros. Home Entertainment also previously announced Bugs Bunny 80th Anniversary Collection, a gorgeous collector's set releasing on November 3 featuring 60 theatrical shorts on Digital and Blu-ray™, as well as a full-size Bugs Bunny glitter Funko figure. Thanks for your time and thoughts, Shariful. What a star he was. Maybe today, I’ll check the app store to check out Looney Tunes games and see if they’re something I could play. I was hoping it would bring back pleasant memories for people. I love what you said about the whole family can be involved. The name of the video game is Looney Tunes.

Also, Wile E Coyote never learned that “no amount” of Acme products would ever help him catch the speedy Road Runner. i enjoyed very much this video games and recommended seen this video games. One thing that I found very interesting here was the relationship built between the character of Looney here. The first major Looney Tunes star was Porky Pig who starred with another cartoon character named Beans. Wow! In 2006 Warner Home Video released a Christmas based film as a parody of the classic “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens. It’s ironic because we’re currently looking for anything to keep us occupied and entertained (because of the lockdown). Oh man you are doing it right with this post.

Around 1988, Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Yosemite, Sylvester, and Tweety made cameo appearances in the movies. YouTube has a lot of the old Looney Tunes cartoons for viewing. I am not promoting that at all. I am so glad this post made you think about those Saturday mornings in your pj’s. Gaming With Grandpa! I agree with you, I love all the characters, but Bugs Bunny is one of my favorites. It still amazes me the range Mel had in doing the voices of so many of the cartoon characters. I enjoyed putting it together. This gave Mel an exceptional range that rivaled that of an opera singer. At this point, some of you may be wondering, “When is johnny going to talk Looney Tunes video games?”. I didn’t realize all the video games based on the Looney Tunes characters until I did my research. It also introduced the love of Bugs’ life, Lola Bunny. Hope everyone will enjoy.

Mel Blanc was the most prolific voice actor in the history of the animation industry. I am glad to meet a fellow Looney Tunes Freak. Actually I have to see it because my son forced me to watch it with him. While reading I know many new things. I grew up watching them almost every Saturday morning while eating breakfast. As I was reading your post, I actually forgot about a few of the characters like Porky the Pig and the Daffy Duck show. Bugs Bunny's birthday this year coincides with the debut of Looney Tunes Cartoons — the HBO Max Original series produced by Warner Bros. Wishing you great health and success in all your goals. I will also veer off into the Looney Tunes cartoons apart from video games. this link is to an external site that may or may not meet accessibility guidelines. You are right, I will never forget these beloved cartoon characters. You are so right; the classics are awesome. I agree the games can be hard to find, but with Google, we can find about anything if we do the research. Thanks for sharing with us such a beautiful article. The show, “Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon” ran until 1999. “Let’s Game with Bugs and all the characters of Looney Tunes.”. Thanks so much for sharing! So i can tell you in my opinion there are loads of people who will agree with both your passions and the market for games and looney toons will definitely be a hit. I hope it brought back good memories. Your comments are so sweet and greatly appreciated. They can be a good escape from the stress of a hard day. Mel Blanc’s exploits with the multiple distinct voices is really a talent to behold, he has been an inspiration to many but i doubt if another voice actor ever matched his dynamism. I am glad you enjoyed it. After cartoons, I was out the door to play and explore my neighborhood. But I do have my favorites. Thank you so much for your kind and encouraging words. I know kids today probably can relate to these classic cartoons. The short was called, “I Haven’t Got a Hat”. Thank you for my trip down memory lane. The CBS  version left in the “antifreeze” joke, but cut the part after that  where Bugs slams a pie in Elmer’s face, sprays him with seltzer, and  whomps him with a mallet before jumping out of his clown suit and  shuffling offstage and the part where Elmer holds a rifle to Bugs’ mouth.
