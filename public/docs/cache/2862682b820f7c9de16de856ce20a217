I just find it strange that this is meant to be a movie that takes place in America even though the look and feel of the housing in Australia is completely different to that of the U.S, especially Florida. This is why future Jess is equipped with a gun and is more hostile than the past Jess who has little idea of what's happening. Triangle sails into some strange waters, but this intelligent, well-acted horror outing anchors its idiosyncrasies in a satisfyingly scary story. The film would have been better served by a stronger sense of the metaphor it was trying to construct, but as it is, the unravelling of the puzzle is underwhelming. George portrays a single mother who goes on a boating trip with several friends. That just seems so to the viewer. We then see Jess watching her other self abusing her son. But their car crashes into a truck that results in her son’s death. Copyright © Fandango. The Triangle (Movie Review) September 13, 2016 by: JimmyO. She then heads off sailing with her group of friends again. Jess1 is then spotted running away. Please bear in mind that I am not going to explain the whole film, just the main point. Apart from the story, the name of Aeolus appears somewhere else. Jess kills herself before shortly coming to the realization that she's still stuck in the time loop even after washing ashore. Downstairs right now is a copy of myself. Although Triangle has some of the dreamlike air of a David Lynch movie, its intricate plot is more akin to Nacho Vigalondo’s similarly excellent sci-fi thriller Timecrimes, mixed with the guilt-ridden angst of Brad Anderson’s The Machinist. April 6, 2013 An underrated gem about death on a boat, Christopher Smith's Triangle is also a classic fable about sin and punishment, Ryan writes... How can Triangle be summed up in just a sentence or two? While running around, Jess1 drops her keys which Jess2 then picks up. It is the name of the mysterious ship they board. The time loop then becomes a form of eternal, sisyphean punishment in which Jess experiences the same events of desperation and murder over and over again. Coherence deals with a dinner party meeting alternate versions of themselves and not knowing which reality was THEIR reality.                      The circle continues after Jess1 (clueless) kills Jess3 (mean), who is then washed ashore on land, only to arrive later on board Aeolus again as Jess1 (clueless). Jess stops the car, picks up the seagull and throws it off a promenade and onto the beach. This leads to Jess killing her other self and telling Tommy that things would be better from now on. This is why future Jess decided to keep repeating the loop until she manages to prevent the group from reaching the ship.                      I would say that the instant she has the car crash with her son was the starting point. Just before her car accident, a seagull strikes her vehicle’s windscreen. Someone is intent on hunting them down, one by one.                      Use the HTML below. Triangle’s recursive story and themes of sin and punishment are underlined by one character’s pointed mention of the Greek myth of Sisyphus: the king sentenced by Zeus to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity. Let me narrate to you, the story of Sisyphus. As the story progresses, we observe Jess as an abusive single mother on a waitress’s salary who probably cracked before killing her autistic son in a fit of frustration and rage.          97 of 127 people found this review helpful. The taxi driver represents Death’s messenger waiting for her to accept the truth and be set free from her circle of eternal suffering. 2: “Learning Jesse” (learning what’s happening, and how to complete loop so she can see her son again). It's not mind-blowing or anything of the sort, but it's got a compelling concept, a strong cast (Melissa George is excellent), smart and accessible scripting and an excellent final act. Fall TV First Look: Find Out What’s Coming, The Best Peacock Original Shows and Movies, All Upcoming Disney Movies: New Disney Live-Action, Animation, Pixar, Marvel, and More. Now, of course, Twilight Zone doesn't own weird shit, but that's a name that people know and love. Please, please help me. From "Veronica Mars" to Rebecca take a look back at the career of Armie Hammer on and off the screen. Walking and talking with Greg.          Jess gets a rare break from the grind of everyday life when she’s invited on a yacht trip by her friend, Greg (Michael Dorman). It's true that, like a ex-partner, the work doesn't always make sense (and that's one in-your-face let down), but the overall effect is tense enough nonetheless to keep one engaged until the questionable conclusion. Of course, after one version of Jess manages to wash ashore after she falls off the ship, she finds her way home and she sees that she used to be a verbally and physically abusive mother.                                         Coming Soon. [Trailer] Shudder’s ‘The Banishing’ Brings Hell Upon a Family, ‘Ghost Ship’ Collector’s Edition Blu-Ray from Scream Factory Coming September 29, Ghost Ship Collector's Edition Blu-ray Will Haunt Us All This September, Underrated Horror and Thriller movies of the 21st Century.                                              |, October 16, 2009 Like Groundhog Day or Edge Of Tomorrow, Triangle could be pigeonholed as a time-loop thriller, as it gradually emerges that Jess is experiencing the same events over and over. What follows is an explanation of what I believe took place in Triangle. A surprisingly satisfying white-knuckler. That gives me the right to put that fancy title with my name. Four friends/fledgling entrepreneurs, knowing that there's something bigger and more innovative than the different error-checking devices they've built, wrestle over their new invention. Stranded at a desolate Nevada motel during a nasty rain storm, ten strangers become acquainted with each other when they realize that they're being killed off one by one. Your email address will not be published. All her friends are now dead. He had to move a rock up a hill. The IMDb score for Triangle is 6.9, which is average – Another reason you should not rely solely on IMDb while hunting down good movies. Three friends discover a mysterious machine that takes pictures twenty-four hours into the future, and conspire to use it for personal gain, until disturbing and dangerous images begin to develop. The yacht is then struck by a storm and the group end up boarding a mysterious ship called Aeolus. Victor2 runs after her, resulting in an accident in which his head is impaled on a sharp protrusion. We watch (sound unheard) as Jess goes about cleaning up after her son. A tense and interesting psychological thriller. Written by                 Triangle So it stands to reason that, for someone who's going into this blind, you compare it to something they know and relate to. She subsequently journeys on to join the sailing trip to relive the phenomenon all over again. PLOT: After hearing from a long lost friend, four filmmakers journey to an unknown area of Montana to record a strange community. Heading off, Jess1 interrupts the meeting between Jess2 and Victor2 which would have resulted in his death, and relates her experience of the time loop. Should he go with his mother or stay with his father? To be honest, it is not that hard to understand. I don't have a real number on how many Sally corpses there were, but 20+ is a conservative guesstimate. We can also say that Jess probably did not die in a car accident on the way to the harbor. There all dead, she killed them all.                      The beginning of the movie is not actually the starting point of the film. She is struggling single mom with a son with Autism. Whatever future Jess left can be found by the past versions of Jess. That's not the weird thing, of course, the weird thing is that all of these corpses are also Sally. First on a yacht and then on an ocean liner after the yacht capsizes after a storm. Jess therefore seems condemned to be trapped in a never-ending circle of purgatory.             | Fresh (32) The weather turns bad and they come across an abandoned Ship named Aeolus. With all of that said, I thought this was a damn good movie and, to be honest, an underappreciated gem. I am the Editor-in-Chief here because I am the only person managing it. Don’t Look Now, in which a bereaved father is apparently haunted by the ghost of his dead daughter. It's the only way to get home! What follows is a superb, well-paced thriller complete with deeper psychological concerns as the central character Jess (Melissa George) attempts to deal with a mysterious time loop. This review perfectly sums up the movie → This Is Barry <Barry’s Review> Triangle is one of those movies that went without notice. Triangle Plot Explanation: The Time-Loops The Triangle movie opens with Jess comforting her autistic son Tommy who’s suffering from a nightmare. Strange things begin to happen when a group of friends gather for a dinner party on an evening when a comet is passing overhead. The fact that they manage to make a really intriguing, but potentially confusing, concept into one that you can watch and understand without even getting deeper into the narrative, which you can also do here. I'll just say that a curiously detached young mother and a group of people go out sailing one gorgeous day, get caught in a storm, and find themselves shipwrecked. This was a never-ending task because as soon as he reached the top, the rock would fall back to the starting place and he would do it all over again.
