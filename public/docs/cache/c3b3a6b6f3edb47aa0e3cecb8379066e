But Arnaz who also enjoyed a few drinks too many thought that Frawley was perfect enough to bring Fred Mertz to life. Broedt appeared in a few other films in 1916, and then again in “Ventriloquist,” her last role, in 1927, always under the name Edna Frawley. The result of this created uncontrollable laughter. I Love Lucy Wiki is a FANDOM TV Community. The actor signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Picture and started to become a well-known name in Hollywood. Frawley and Vance were savvy enough to not jeopardize their jobs on TV’s most successful show by openly airing their mutual hostility. Ball was surp… He next moved to Broadway and then, in 1932, to Hollywood with Paramount. Although a highly successful "working actor" in films, Frawley's movie career had begun to slow down by 1951. He had to convince the directors. A rabid New York Yankees baseball fan, Frawley had it written into his I Love Lucy contract that he did not have to work during the World Series if the Yankees were playing. He became ill and had to take off much time to recover and regain his strength. So, in mid-1951, when actress Lucille Ball contacted Frawley about the possibility of taking on the role of gruff landlord Fred Mertz in her new comedy television series, I Love Lucy, she and her husband/co-star Desi Arnaz were more than a bit leery. Although the two actors shared a great comedic and musical chemistry on-screen, they greatly disliked each other in real life. The actor's bad habits and negative attitude caused him many trials and tribulations during his career. Since then, the two developed a hatred for each other, throughout their time working together. "Bye, Bye Bonnie," "The Gingham Girl," "Sons o' Guns," and "She's My Baby" (with Bea Lillie, Clifton Webb, and Irene Dunne). (Note: The word "coot" may have been replaced by a much cruder epithet by Vance.) I Image: Wikimedia Commons. The first screw-up would be tolerated, the second would get him a severe reprimand, and the third would get him fired. The roles were soon drying up, however. William Frawley (February 26, 1887 - March 3, 1966) was the actor who played Fred Mertz, the husband of Ethel Mertz (played by Vivian Vance) and landlord and friend to the Ricardos in I Love Lucy. Arnaz, the show's producer, made sure his friend was well-paid; by the end, Frawley was pulling $7,500 a week, a very generous rate for the time, plus a good residual deal (which few actors had in the early days of television). Despite his animosity toward Vance, Frawley did develop one of the few genuine friendships of his life during I Love Lucy, becoming close with Desi Arnaz. We and other data collection technologies to provide the best experience for our customers. Until he was given a second chance, however reluctantly, by actors (and husband and wife) Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, the stars of “I Love Lucy.” Ball and Arnaz played the leading couple Lucy and Ricky Ricardo in the different versions of the series. Eggs weren't used during rehearsals so their onscreen reactions were genuine when the shells cracked and slimed its way down their skin. William Frawley was born in Burlington, Iowa. However, Vance refused categorically since she wasn’t willing to ever work with the actor again. In 1916, Frawley signed a contract with Paramount Studios to appear in silent films. No one will believe I’m married to that old coot,” Frawley heard Vance say. I Love Lucy, which debuted October 15, 1951 on CBS, was a huge success. After four years, in 1914 he formed a light comedy act with his new wife Edna Louise Bloedt, "Frawley and Louise," touring the Orpheum and Keith vaudeville circuits until they divorced in 1927. To the contrary, Frawley never showed up drunk to work, and, in fact, mastered his lines after only one reading. Frawley was born more than ten years before the 20th century even started, in 1887. Despite his mother’s views on theater, which she considered to be sinful, Frawley felt drawn to performing from a young age already and his interests in it peaked. One evening, Frawley phoned Lucille Ball, asking her what his chances were. He nearly lost it all because of his troubled personality, but thanks to the second chance he had with Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, he spent his final years doing what he does best. Gordon was unavailable, however, due to a prior commitment. He is thought of fondly for this role but many still despise his off-screen persona. In 1966, less than a year after his last TV appearance, Frawley passed away on March 3, at the age of 79. Age: N/A . I Image: Getty Images. Edna Louise Broedt has been divorced from William Frawley since 1927. Even though Frawley landed acting roles in silent movies as early as 1916, it was with the arrival of sound that he started to show his immense talent and where he could make use of the Irish accent, which he learned firsthand from his parents. By 1951, the 64 year-old Frawley had appeared in over one hundred films. Eddie Deezen has appeared in over 30 motion pictures, including Grease, WarGames, 1941, and The Polar Express.  Actor Gale Gordon, a friend of Lucille Ball's, was the first choice to play the character. Then he moved to Broadway and appeared in such shows as "Here's Howe!" Bitten by the show biz bug, he soon began performing a vaudeville act with his brother Paul. Add a child for this couple. If the company didn't get his scenes filmed in the mornings, Frawley would sometimes nod off in the middle of afternoon filmings. The role of Fred Mertz was played by William Frawley, who was actually 22 years her senior. Even co-workers like Keith Thibodeaux (Little Ricky, a.k.a. Frawley, by then 64 years old, long-divorced, and unemployed, living alone in his Hollywood apartment, agreed to Arnaz's terms and was to conduct himself professionally over the course of the next nine years, until the show and its follow-up series, The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour, ended their legendary runs in 1960. At first she didn't want the part (too frumpy), and hated being cast as the wife of William Frawley (she was 42, he was 64, and the two never got along). For this reason, amongst many others pertaining to his conduct, there were fewer and fewer people willing to work with him on the set. Things took a wrong turn with co-stars Frawley and Vance, since the moment the former overheard the latter tell Ball and Arnaz that no one was going to believe that she was married to such an old man. In honor of his friend, Arnaz paid for a full-page ad in several newspapers with the words “Buenos Noches, amigo.” He was also one of the pallbearers at the late star’s funeral. Whatever she actually did say, Frawley was never to forgive her and, for the next nine years, although they played one of the funniest husband and wife teams in TV history, by all accounts the two hated each other. Despite his long history of playing vicious and sarcastic characters, and the rude Fred that resembled his true personality so much, Frawley spent his last five years playing the role of a devoted grandfather, which he is still remembered for. Vance's Ethel Mertz character was the landlady of a New York City apartment that she and her husband Fred owned on East 68th Street.

In the brief cameo, as Frawley walks by, Lucy turns her head, sees him, and remarks, "He reminds me of someone I used to know. Gordon was unavailable, however, due to a prior commitment. And he's done thousands of voice-overs for radio and cartoons, such as Dexter's Laboratory and Family Guy. In 1934 he played a con man in “The Lemon Drop Kid.” Ten years later he opposed Bing Crosby in “Going My Way,” and in 1947 he shared the screen with no other than Charlie Chaplin. Late actor William Frawley played Fred Mertz in the classic TV sitcom from the late fifties “The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour” during its entire run and made an appearance in “I Love Lucy” in 1956. His drinking did, of course, become problematic. Much like his I Love Lucy stint, Frawley's My Three Sons work was done professionally and without incident. The man who achieved television immortality as Fred Mertz on I Love Lucy was born in Burlington, Iowa, on February 26, 1887. As a boy he sang at St. Paul's Catholic Church and played at the Burlington Opera House. A final interesting fact about the show that might surprise fans is about the longest laugh on the show. That's over 1 minute. Lucille Ball was hoping to cast Gale Gordon, whom she’d worked with on her My Favorite Husband radio show.
