Jewish British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen (aka Borat), failed to take the stage with a win for adapted screenplay, losing out to Martin Scorsese's The Departed. </p> <p>", Sandel chose a musical comedy, he said, because this is "a way of abstracting the story of the conflict, taking the suffering out of it so that people can let down their defenses and identify with the characters on both sides. A short musical comedy about rival Palestinian and Israeli falafel stands in the West Bank was awarded the Oscar for best live action short film Sunday. Arkin played a heroin-smoking, womanizing grandfather in Little Miss Sunshine.

"So many other people support this notion, so perhaps hope is not hopeless." </p> <p>It's a lot easier to see Jews and Arabs dancing together than to see them fighting. At the end of the film, both sides are forced to work together to fill local residents' endless appetite for hummus.

Sherry Lansing, former head of Paramount studios and an activist in civic and Jewish charities, was presented with the Academy's Humanitarian Award. And when the Israelis plan to build a separation fence between the restaurants, the Palestinians burst into laughter: "Jews and construction?

David, an Israeli soldier, falls in love with the beautiful Palestinian cashier Fatima despite the animosity between their families’ dueling restaurants and centuries of Middle East conflict. The film focuses on two fast food stands that specialize in falafel and hummus - "Kosher King," run by Jewish West Bank residents, and "Hummus Hut," run by Palestinians.

Even though he visits Israel every year, Sandel, whose mother is American and whose father is Israeli, repeatedly noted that he was careful to maintain balance in his film. And indeed, when things heat up on the screen, the characters from both sides drop English and start cursing in their Semitic languages. Cette comédie franchement drôle met en scène une boulangerie juive et un fast food palestien qui se livrent évidemment la guerre mais qui évidemment aussi fera naître un amour ô combien interdit !
